      "I'm very happy with the set.  Although not listed in the specs it must have a QAM tuner because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable.  I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD without paying for digital cable almost made me weep with happiness.The picture quality for analog channels is only soso.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives I'm very happy \n",
      "My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs all day every day and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK the video of one contributor was poor and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.Setup was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10000 ft. above sea level.I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kickoff.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks and then in Denver for another week before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.All in all a great set at a great price I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner \n",
      "So I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck it wouldn't work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn't find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn't matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It's not a nightandday difference but it's a noticeable improvement. Sure I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weakersignaled LX mode not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better stronger signal. This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it's control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I'll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already as I do a lot of driving* I say If you can buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it's not an option and you don't want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain old radio. \n",
      "I have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it's biggest star. You can format your hard drive put in the restore disk that you create for your system and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an \"ABC\" book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use \n",

I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV and the audio lives well for my expectations.No lag while playing my Playstation 2 console...The only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode you need to press \"SOURCE\" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it's annoying waiting for it...but besides that it's a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space \n",

      "The intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I've heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it \n",

That's all there is to it that's what it does and it does it well. On the down side and it's a small and transient down side actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick security wise is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.I use this on a 20d which typically has a 24200 or 80400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don't have an issue. If Canon read this you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here \n",

      "This is an excellent machine.  I bought two of them.  There are a few things you need to do.  I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVDR up to 8x.  I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs  other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.One of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVDRAM.  They are rerecordable for many many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVDRAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVDRAM.  I have over 50 DVDRAM discs (Panasonic brand)  they sure take up less space than VCR tapesGet one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made  Throw away your VCRs forever  Just remember to baby them \n",
      "I bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I'm sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders but for under $200 you really can't go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn't seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online everything went smoothly.  Because of that I'm still going to give it a full 5 stars..it's not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.  Really if you're new to this technology you're not going to have any problems..believe me..A++ \n",

A few annoyances  The machine responds and loads slowly but that's not too bad a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.

      "I've owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality  lots of hardy Walkmen useful shortwave and portable radios stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FHE656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+ but rather than pay to fix its wornout CD player I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).PLUSES decent soundgood functionalityeasy setup and intuitive operationsimple remote  but only covers basic functionsCONSvery short speaker leadsunattractive styling (for my tastes)  resembles a boomboxonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic unitsAt first glance I was disappointed by the cheap construction skimpy manual and very short speaker leads  the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought in 2006 for $150 I can't expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So for the money it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works  to be safe this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven't blasted it at full volume but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.I originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SCPM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn't have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).

      "(Note to Brian The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)Major modes of operation are1. Wireless Access Point (its default setup)2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them  acts as one end of a \"virtual\" cable you need two to get the job done)A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian's comment that this wouldn't work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.1. I understand that higherend more expensive equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well it's not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.3. Something that 99% of the world won't care about  I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do lowlevel analysis of the box and the network it's attached to. I think there are thirdparty firmware loads that enable this \n",

One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs.This case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine.  My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out.  It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction.  Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface.It will protect your pod though \n",

The directions do not state this and I had to call Linksys to get it to work.Other than that it is fast reliable and small.  Perfect \n",
      "My setup Dell Latitude PP01L (Intel chip) Win XP Pro DLink DI624 Wireless Router (with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna) Enabled the WEP featureI unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in.  Windows found the new card and did its PlugnPlay thing.  Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn't 'see' with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card.  This I sort of expected but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers.The CD installed just fine but when I went to the DLink site to check for an updated driver it said I was uptodate.  I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new DLink card. I've never had a problem with DLink's website (or customer service while we're on the subject) so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of DLink's site.  Either way...  install the card and get onto the internet then have Windows Update check for possible updates.Be sure to enable the encryption feature.  If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can't go snooping through your stuff.  Or worse lift the signal and ultimately your personal information.I've had no problems with my current setup.  I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop uptodate \n",
      "This review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. The cord is about 2.5 feet long  long enough to reach from my pc which sits on the ground to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs  one just to transmit data the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavyduty hardware and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing then it does have an input for a separate power source which you will have to buy separately. In short If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk \n",

      "For those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording this product is wonderful.  Especially good for recording lectures voice lessons etc.  It works quite well with the builtin mono mike or you could use an external one.One of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike  you toggle which setting it is in the settings section.I record my radio shows by plugging in the lineout from the station's tape deck to my iRiver.For those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs it's a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before  you can't change it on the fly.I've recorded live DJ shows with the builtin and AGC on.  Of course the booming bass distorts horribly but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.I've also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I'm still refining with later iRiver products.The single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2 2hour classes and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording fear not the file is savedThe negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external draganddrop drive.Files are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don't know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can't trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver even if you made them yourself so don't think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.Also the molding where the linein input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.I've had mine for just over a year now and use it every day whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I'm only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses it's starting to wear out.  But it's still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.I have the 1G model (iFP799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12hour radio show marathon I produced with it.  Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.I'm quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future \n",

It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It's actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It's actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can't except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model.

Unfotunately it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.

      "I have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories. It works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 56 lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment which is nice. I really can't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution consider this you won't regret it. \n",

      "I use the pink circles to buff the cd/dvd and it leaves the circular marks all over the cd as I thought it would. Well I thought that those marks would disappear after I used the repair paste with the yellow circles but they're still there. Is it supposed to be like this? The reason I bought the thing was to make the cds look like new but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over.Could someone answer this question for me please \n",
      "With boys aged 2 &amp 3 and some poor disc storage procedures when I'm driving it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs but it occassionally happens and doesn't take long for scratches damage and finger prints to hinder performance and when changing children's cds in the car I don't always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power is fully contained and automatic and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews  mostly positive but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I'm very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all and one that skipped.  This product repairs a disc to \"useable\" condition it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It's also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well but shows scratches  I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  I agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items  but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime) then buff then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use.  \n",

      "I've read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed. THIS IS NOT TRUE if you're carefull.  First of all my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries.  Pretty simple huh?  Also don't wait for your battery to completely die before you change it.

However the software includes a \"monitoring\" feature which checks every second or so to see if you've plugged in a card.  I opened up Windows Task Manager to discover that each time it checked it was consuming 25% of system resources (on/off each second).

I can't tell you how many pieces of junk I've bought that barely pulledin even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the builtin speaker just like transistor radios of the 50's and 60'sa seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial I really don't think you have a choice but to pick up this radio \n",

      "This was my second DLO transpod. I had an older white one that I bought used. I figured I would \"upgrade\" to this one since my iPod and my car's interior are black. overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one but with a few little changes.For one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts. That normally doesn't matter if you choose a good empty frequency but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect. Next I can't turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.Last the most annoying part of this whole product is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use. I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.Since my car doesn't leave me many options for stereo replacement this is the best product for my specific situation though I may try and get that old one back from my friend...maybe an \"upgrade\" to a newer one will settle the deal \n",

      "The reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...I could only start with at 2.1 set up  L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.Tons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy secure connection.  Lots of component video SVHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  Really easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.Did I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich  great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.Best of all my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.The end result  I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver \n",
      "This item does exactly what it's suppose to do. It also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception. Worth the money. Only drawback would be there is a lot of cord hanging around \n"

      "The Sony SSMF650H are a lowcost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.Though I have not had the opportunity to test the ultrahigh (up to 50kHz) frequency the highs on these speakers sound very well maybe only slightly boxy  note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.The sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However don't get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.The bass is very punchy and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers as their highs are very good and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the subwoofer... don't worry low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won't suffer). In other words you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their outofthe box quality.Ignore the 50kHz rating for ultrahighfrequency sound as a positive feature as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz  20kHz at a reasonable RMS.You get what you pay for... for the price tag on them the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound) and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity  especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them) the sound quality suffers.I would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you're willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.I also demoed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady but excellent for the price  seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you're looking for deep and bassheavy sound without a subwoofer and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SSMF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though so if you have a big room shop around for something better. \n",

I've been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends  the highs are crisp and the bass is tight not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I'd definitely recommend this speaker set \n",

      "These headphones are lightweight fairly comfortable and sound head and shoulders better than any pair of $20 headphones I've ever heard.  Here are the aspects people always want to know aboutBASS these don't pound your eardrums in but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I've heard.  You can really follow the bass line with these rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration.MIDS/HIGHS this is the reason to buy these headphones.  Not too bright but very clear warm smooth soothing and musical.  The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string something I'd never heard before on that song.  In fact I blame these headphones on my new addiction to well headphones.These obviously can't play as loudly as $200 headphones and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don't think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20 you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.

The durability of the cables... I don't know.  But unless you're someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason it wouldn't matter.  Normally you'd connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline This is as good as the expensive ones.

In fact I can hear things in some of my music that I never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam onear style or earbud styles.  This is good when listening to original CDs or HQ mp3/AAC but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that I had just not heard before...I tested these with a frequency response program on my Mac show as having 2515600 Hz (in my ears your ears may vary...) .  This range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds.They do a good job of blocking out external noises great if you are in a bit of a noisy space.And yes they were a bit tight on the head initially.  To fix that I got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches (pun intended). This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.  NOTE this procedure is at your own risk as I do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg.  )   Do not overstretch them as the headband material while flexible undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take.Great Bargain Headphones \n",

      "I bought these headphones a week ago and I am very pleased with them. At the electronic store I listen to 3 pairs of Sennheiser (HD433  HD437 and HD457). I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8VX motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW  I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.I do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.Overall I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.When it comes to music I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer) so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.Very good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong. I highly recommand them for computer users (music DVD movies and games) \n",

I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won't miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it's always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file.

You want the 16x9 profile also the regular square LCDs look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios. The newer stuff is very bright and clear. It is obvious when you go to a store and look at the LCD screens. The cheap $200 LCDs just don't look good in comparison to the new stuff.Intel iMac screen1680x1050280 cd/m2 (brightness in candle power)8001 Contrast ratioApple 20\" LCD1680x1050250 cd/m2  4001 Contrast14ms response time (www.apple.com/displays/specs.html)Other comparablesGateway 21\" 1680x1050 $599300 cd/m2  10001 contrastDell 24\" 2405FPW $8001920 x 1200500 cd/m210001 contrastYou should be aiming for at least 300 cd/m2 on brightness and close to 10001 contrast.  These Apple LCDs have been out for awhile and are starting to show their age in comparison to the brand new products that have just started to come out. If you are using your LCD for a TV you may need the brightness but for computer work the Mac 20\" LCD is just about right. I paid a few $$$ more ($750 total price) for the Apple LCD but I feel I made the correct purchase. I just didn't like the way the others looked and it had to look good against my iMac. I actually like this screen better than the one on my iMac and it seems just as bright even if the specs say that it is not. Amazon also boxes the shipment (besides the Apple box) so your screen should arrive undamaged \n",
      "I've been slowly making my way to the Mac side after nearly 15 years of unadulterated Windows/DOS use.  The process has been slow mainly because of the price and availability of Apple products  High and Scarce.The best thing about Apple is that their customer forums are full of people like you and me and if you have a problem someone else has most likely had it too.  Those forums helped in my decision to purchase this monitor.I had been looking closely at the 23\" monitor.  When I read about a majority of the displays getting a pink tint after only a few hours of use I realized I would either wait until Apple reengineered the monitor or look at other options.With the 20\" Aluminum I didn't have to look far.  I wanted a monitor that would compliment my G4 laptop (Powerbook) but I didn't want to break the bank either.  The answer was turning to ebay.  $600 out the door.  Mint condition.  Saved over $150 and the monitor works and looks greatThe 20\" and 30\" models have had no problems.  If you can buy them new go for it.  If you can buy new but would rather spend that extra money on something else check out the ebay auctions \n",

      "These are the best portable headphones in this price range.  Good bass and smooth natural sound. In fact they would probably still be the best bang for the buck at three times the price.  If you can afford more consider the Sennheiser PX100 for about 4050 dollars. But if you're on a budget or don't want to worry about losing or breaking a more expensive pair of headphones these are definitely the ones to get \n",
      "Excellent mount for the 2 TV's I've purchased.  Was suprised to buy one about a month ago from amazon.com for 149.95 then was able to buy this one for 124.95.  Did I pay too much for the first mount?       Ollie........... \n",

      "It's not listed in the product description but the Pico works with the iPod Mini too.  Like the other reviewers I found it easy to setup tune the radio turn on iPod connect the Pico tune the Pico done).  In my car the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality my other car has a builtin iPod connector.  The Pico sound quality is comparable somewhat muted but enjoyable.  The Pico does offer the advantage of displaying the iPod menu to select tunes.  I've read mixed reviews on other FM transmitters but I am pleased with the Pico \n",
      "I ordered this device to sit on a player piano which can play ipod encoded MP3 files once they are transferred from the special CDs that are designed for the piano.  The remote is limited as are all remotes for ipods but for the special use I have this is a great product.  It allows me to sit across the room and pause the piano or select the next piece of music \n",
      "I was looking for an inexpensive yet high quality long lasting and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane. A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750 I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters it does not offer a dash or hyphen so when one is  required I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter \n",
      "We recently purchased 4 of these phones and all of them work fine. The CID works perfectly for both lines. The interface/menu takes a few minutes to learn and get used to but I wouldn't call it \"nonintuitive\".The Redial button (as you can see in the picture) is right above the number pad. If you can't find it you might want to buy a phone with less buttons and less features. And it's pretty simple to redial a number in the CID display... when you see/get to the number press Enter twice (Once to bring up the \"MENU\" and Once more to \"DIAL\"). In fact you can also save that number into the phone's memory through the menu (press Enter once and scroll through the options) \n",
      "At first I was not sure about if this Windshield Mounting Bracket was going to stay in place while I drive trough the streets. However I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise.Pros Strong suction rubber system GPS mounting systemCons Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing  that's why I give 4 stars \n",
      "Very strong suction cup provides secure mounting. Quick and easy clip in and release for taking the GPS with you. Product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways. Otherwise this is a welldesigned and quality product \n",
      "The forums speak highly of these unitsxr70 and I was going to get one because of the small form factor. Amazon's description for the height at 2.5\" is incorrect according to Panasonic's website. Should be listed as 3 9/32\"H. Makes a difference if you're short on space \n",
      "I was paranoid about having buyer's remorse from this unit. For such a cheap price I was sure I would end up regretting the purchase. What is the tradeoff? Shoot if know but I haven't regretted buying it one bit. The receiver is perfect for home theater particularly DD 5.1 shows. There is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content which is important for TV watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments.As for power it's not an even match with some of the more power hungry and expensive analog amplifiers out there but it easily crosses the threshold of annoying the neighbors.Digital is something to get used to. On conventional receivers you turn the sound up high and it becomes somewhat sloppy or what some call \"warm\". Not so with the digital Panny. It's distortion free up to very high levels. I wouldn't call it bright but the response is very linear and precise. I like hearing all the details in music and cinema even at loud volume. Others don't.The weaknesses are very minorThe FM tuner is nothing special.It lacks fancy DSP modes of expensive receivers.No fancy on screen display (must do most of the tweaking with knobs)It does not upconvert video.The remote control is an el cheapo.For this price though who cares \n",
      "I purchased this receiver from Fry's Electronics in San Diego CA for $199.99. At first I was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver. When I got it home and connected it I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it's home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30's as my fronts and rear surround and two Sony center channels for my front center and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system and my little system blows his out of the water and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price this is the way to go. By the way did I mention that it has four digital inputs an optical output and HDMI in and out connections. BUY IT \n",
      "The logitech stereo usb noice cancelling headset is awesome... I never recieved the one I ordered from ANT online but the one I bought later at walmart owns me \n",
      "I did a lot of research and finally ended up with this product. 1) BOSE is an excellent piece  but main drawbacks  portability and lack of audio input from other devices2) Altec Lansing  basically a roun cylinder shaped one and I didnt get that in a black color for my 30 GB Black Video Ipod and the sound wasnt that impressive as Bose (or for that matter Logitech mm 50)3) Apple's ipod Dock  its a bulky one that is definitely not portable and costlier than the Bose. I went to BestBuy to listen to everything and Logitech mm 50 really outweighs the other ones on these  price portability and sound quality yea its not like Bose or Apple's dock  but really good for such a small piece. The only thing I find a little difficult is I am not able to switch playlists with the remote its just for play/pause/next/prev and sounds would've been completely happy if had all that I could do in the ipod. But I am very happy with the buy and will definitely recommend to bu \n",
      "I've had 2 other FM transmitters (A Belkin and a Griffin iTrip). Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries which only lasted about 15 hours of use) while the iTrip worked OK at first but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit although it seems cheap and flimsy at first is able to get a consistant strong signal even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle but once you set the 3 presets you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 123 configuration. Also turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all I couldn't be happier \n"

      "I've had these headphones for just over two years and I'm happy to see that they're one of the few pairs marketed as \"surround sound\" that have done quite well. The reason behind that is because they're truly excellent headphones. The range is spectacular and the inputs even more so. You're given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical) which is all you really need. Movies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind in front and to your left and right when you're connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds 'boomier' and a tad crisper than Dolby D does especially in Gladiator. Honestly I've nothing to complain about. As a college guy I couldn't bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which I might add never sounded as good as my headphones mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You'd be amazed at Coldplay's \"The Scientist\" if you heard it on these headphones. It's indescribable.And by the way I'm a slight audiophile.You seriously can't go wrong with these headphones. And $65 for each additional pair of headphones allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station? Even better...good idea for families in apartments.Incredibly advanced technology incredible sound and incredible results. Can't go wrong here.Oh and they're extremely comfy \n",
      "I just recently purchased the Quickcam STX for my sister who lives overseas in Greece. It's a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis. Surprisingly the video and audio is quite good. I do have a Mac and she doesn't have any issue calling me from her pc.  We use Aol instant messenger (Video and Audio) or Yahoo Messenger (Video) to connect.  I still prefer the iSight for Macs.  Unfortunately you can't use an iSight on a pc. Wish Apple could make the iSight compatible with PC's. Anyhow the STX is a great cam for what it's worth. \n",

      "I found the sound fantastic. Just got these after usinf Shure E3s for about a year. I liked those but find these even better. When I first tried them I found the base so much stronger than the E3s as many have alluded to. Now I run my iPod at normal equalizer settings. I find the balance of the set dead on. The fit is great of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected) \n",
      "This is my second FM transmitter and works much better than the Belkin that I ended up returning because it simply wasn't working.It plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there unlike the Belkin (I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci). It is easy to use with the preset FM stations. It works right out of the box you'll be ready to go within seconds. The sound is crisp with some static interference which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car's antenna helps a little but doesn't completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.There is nothing to mount the iPod so you'll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately.I wouldn't spend more than $45 on any FM transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas. I won't be getting rid of my CD changer just yet \n",
      "I have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase extra 1100mAh battery and auto power cord.Strengths Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies photos games word processing and anything else I can throw at it.  The other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  The battery life is phenomenal even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  WiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected it keeps the signal well and is while not fast reasonable for speedJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.Weaknesses Not enough programs to start with Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP it's way better)Problems Don't use Odyssey Client it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also in ActiveSync On the PDA select Menu Add Server Source.  On all of the screens put random characters in each field and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu options and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.Conclusion An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well \n",
      "This phone has noticably greater range and clarity than our other wireless phones. The message center works well and the intercom feature is useful.

The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1 but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality.Video calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement but for basic conversations it is fine.  I use 8 Mbs cable and I connect with people using the same or high speed DSL.This camera takes great video &amp photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you.  If you want to take a large group shot it is really cool.  The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well.  I don't use the face tracking.  The base deserves a mention too.  I use this on my notebook and on my desktop.  It's cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces.

No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior. Just plug it in and use.The keyboard is soso. It is not bad but just not very comfortable especially compared to Microsoft keyboards. (I use Microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines).

      "Like most people here I found the Bose Triport headphones to have excellent sound but the plastic on mine also broke in the recess next to the earcups.  What I found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic.  In fact the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended.My recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic.  Bose replaced them with no hassles no receipt no registration just sent them back and got a brand new pair.  I think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago \n",
      "I recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It's great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich loud enough and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers the Traveldock has the best bass to date in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use which are on the back of the unit.  Also the Microphoto charges while docked whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's adjust volume and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto. \n",
      "Again Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package line in jack usb port fm antenna and even a jack for a subwoofer for a small portable speaker this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the conslike most reviewersi too have to say the bass is lacking a bit and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price this speaker system is very good.    i tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.right now im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.one more thing if your going to use the linein cable for a device other than the zen micro be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers linein jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review. I love these speakers and i even use them for my t.v and they sound great for that too \n",
      "I bought these speakers based on price because I just wanted to get some budget speakers to start off with on my home theater.  It turns out that these speakers have amazing sound quality easily rivaling speakers that cost 10x the price.I really can't find one bad thing to say.  Even at high volumes they have a crystal clear pristine sound.  The sub woofer pumps a nice rich heavy bass. Take advantage of the low price on these speakers you won't find a better deal.I'm using these speakers with a Harman Kardon AVR 240 receiver and I also have two Polk R15's as my front left and right \n",

I did a wedding album using Canon photo paper and the couple I gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they'd hired which speaks volumes to the quality of Canon paper.I'd highly recommend that people use this brand.

      "Echoing most other reviews here this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk If you don't wear these earphones correctly they sound terrible easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.Learning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips Before inserting the earbuds draw the phones up from behind your ear holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially) so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is swallow) just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.It may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does and success is not guaranteed.  But it's worth it And to save your hearing don't forget to turn down the volume since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise \n",
      "This was the largest set that would fit into my space. I also looked at the Westinghouse 37 inch HD moniter at Best Buy. The first time I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy. Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp. I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD the picture is amazing. It's also quite good on regular TV. My only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in. If I  had known I would have waited to check out that model \n",

      "This is a great little piece of hardware. I bought it for my MP3's and movies and I'm very pleased. It's totally \"plugnplay\" there aren't even any drivers that need updating assuming you have XP up to par. It gives 160GB (well 149 in actuality) of space to work with. After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once on the first day it froze up. After that minor incident I've had no problems though and my machine runs alot faster because of it. With my 100G of music already on it I'm very happy with it. It has given me no fussit doesn't even give me any noise It's as silent as a fart and that's a big plus.I found mine at WalMart for $114 and I think that I made a good purchase. If you're on a budget this is about as good as it gets. Seagate's 300GB is also highly recommended as I've worked with it before. A+ \n",

      "I purchased this radio to keep on my kitchen counter.  I chose Boston Acoustics over Tivoli because you can't preset the stations in the Tivoli and I like to flip through commercials. Other reviewers wrote that the bass can be overpowering.  I listen to rock music and do not notice the bass. My complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly.  It does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house.  Also if you are listening to the radio you can't see the time display.This radio is great if you have limited space.  It looks good and sounds like a much larger radio. It has a lot of power for a small radio. \n",

When I called their office for advice one of the tech guys (excellent service by the way) told me the Monster banana plugs were great not the best or most expensive available but a good value. That was enough for me. My speakers are biwired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful.

      "Netgear clearly has not figured out how to make their RangeMax adapter work well with the Microsoft XP operating system.  If you're not a techie I'd stay away until Microsoft has certified the WPN311. Here's what I experienced1. Installed using the Netgear WPN311 automated configuration.2. After installation completion and boot up CPU utilization was at a solid 100%.  Executable from Netgear named WLANCFG5.EXE taking up a bunch of the CPU and Microsoft routines CSRSS.EXE NET.EXE and NET1.EXE taking the rest.3. Emailed Netgear and received response to use Task Manager to delete WLANCFG5.EXE.  Did so for all users.4. Hey  CPU utilization returned to normal5. Sent next email to Netgear pointing out that this solution is just a \"patch\" and WLANCFG5 would return when I rebooted.6. Received response to deinstall and reinstall software for WPN311.7. Did so but then Netgear adapter software could not find my MIMO wireless router  And usage of the Netgear adapter software doesn't allow you to use the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configurator (WZC).8. Went to microsoft.com and looked up error 871122 \"Error message when you try to run the Wireless Network Setup Wizard\" and followed the instruction to allow usage of WZC.9.

      "For the background I've owned &amp used various IEM (InEarMonitor) headphones over the years Ety ER4p Altec Lansing iM716 Shure E2c Sony EX71 Koss KSC75.  Here's my quick impression after using these headphones for a weekPros1. Very good bass &amp well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71 the ER4p has tight but the least bassfeel/effect.)  Midrange is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones I'd need to crank up the vol.)3. Very light weight4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &ampiM716 have better isolation)6. Moderately priced ($50)Cons1. Cables are thin so handle with care.2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones some are more than others.3. No pouch or casePS For bassheads you will like these IEMs  from an owner of Beyer DT77080's experience  \n",
      "All inear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it's physics there's nothing you can do about that.  Now these earphones are incredibly lightweight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  These headphones are called \"asymmetric\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn't spill on the wire.I paid about 60 bucks and for that price I love these headphones.  Face it these are low to midrange in terms of price but perform more like midrange to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair \n",

      "I love the new nanos. I don't think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket which might annoy some people but not me. I'd rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren't as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don't know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me The new color coating is scratch resistant but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don't notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano 24 hours The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I'm so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily have a dark screen and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good reliable scratch resistant cool looking music player 5/5 star \n",

      "These Verbatims are terrific.  As you may know working with DVDR media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps but even then some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually you're safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim's are made in Taiwan but they are great..I've bought one every couple months and I'm on my 3rd spindle now.They have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200).  Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos.  Not one coaster so far burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMRE55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly).  So far I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung Sanyo Panasonic Sony Apex Toshiba DVD Players PS2 XBox no problems) .  Over 134 discs so far and they look great play great and are a great price for hub printable discs.   Highly recommended...I'm ordering more \n",
      "Notebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.

My old one \"Quickcam for notebooks Pro\" still a champion after use of 3 years now. I got bored and gave it to my uncle. And boy he loves it too. Newer one as mentioned by other reviewers holds much better.Do I sound Like a logitech sales person? Well I must admit that I am very happy with their webcams.

      "Unlike many other cables that splice A/V output this cable does so while retaining the details of that output.  I.e. both Left and Right channels are extracted and outputted not simply the Left channel with audio mixed down to mono.  Also it works on some computers tooOn the minus side I haven't gotten it to work on the television.  In order to do so you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player.I bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an XRocker chair with built in speakers and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible too.

      "I am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording  saves to a variety of formats etc. Very handy The unit did all that it promised but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation but not recording or EQ.Needed additions1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations  kind of klunky. Better to have \"radio buttons\" associated with the App window. To be fair the Widget does have better station selection but the button is labeled with a 'heart'...2. No station \"scan\" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually  wow  hard to understand this lack of functionality.3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multiband EQ that works well mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this  AUDACITY.Oddities1. When first installed the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful  as with most tech support offerings they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions.

All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price but after trying various models of earbuds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones KOSS of course  And man they still have it.  These aren't the greatest phones I've ever heard but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that) they easily compare to some wellknown sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally no awful himid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable I think I would rather have the traditional overthehead band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice full the bass doesn't thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it's smooth.  And most important you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt these are the best budget phones I've ever owned  My bottom line anyone who doesn't grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g \n",

      "I've bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I've used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems TV Cable Box and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)I believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.What do you REALLY get for a \"high end\" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don't know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive and of course it sounds great but these cables sound great too.  Plus these cables ARE Monster cables AND they are THX certifiedWhat does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology offering products and services of unparalleled quality for postproduction distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"A digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable it uses light to transmit the digital data it doesn't degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables they just are going be a little less durable and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).Overall I'm very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver TV Cable Box Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)(P.S. for first time users don't forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away you'll never need them again. \n",

      "I purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully the same time I read that Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15 after mailin rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far not bad... My laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I'll admit the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often) you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibbleif you really wanted to you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise\" which you don't really notice until you purposely try to listen for it The high setting on the other hand is a bit loud and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually though I only use the high setting when it's really hot in the room or if I'm running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. Overall I'd say I'm very satisfied with this product. (Though I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.)  \n",

      "I bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They've both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs which makes it look raggedy but the comfort and sound quality isn't affected by it so I don't consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it \"should\" but likewise it's something to be expected with this much use and hasn't affected comfort.The cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I'm used to which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.I've compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ50's (which I own) and a library's Koss UR10's or 15's (can't remember which).  Though the QZ50's do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on the UR20's are the most comfortable of the three have the richest bass are the most durable and won't eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ50's \n",

I had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another Microsoft \"ergonomic\" mouse a year ago which became chronic but barely noticeable until I tried the 6000.I also tried a Logitech V200 which is a good mouse just not nearly as comfortable as the 450.  The buttons on both of these Logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless.  This was not so on the MS 6000.If you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook the Logitech V450 is it.  My hands are fairly large and for the $15 more than the v200 it is definitely worth it as I spend a lot of time on computers \n",

Finally  I dont have to change mouse sensativities when I unplug it.  The Setpoint sensativity is an offset to window's sensativity setting for the touchpad.  So basically set your touchpad sensativity first then adjust the Setpoint sensativity.

There's just no other easy way I've found to keep track of all my receipts.  Even with some of the negativity about the accuracy on the receipt recognition I still wanted to try this out for myself.I noticed the following will increase the accuracy of the receipt scanning1) Scan your receipt ASAP once you have it.  Receipts are pretty cheap in quality and will fade over time.  Also for that matter you risk the chance of loosing the receipt the longer you don't scan it in.  =)2) Ink quality on the receipt matters.It does the best job when the dots of the letters/number are together and dark.3)wording on the receipt.e.g. the receipt can say visa/mc then scanner will pick it as visa.Business card scans have been excellent for me.

I wish there was the option for half stars  I'd give this 41/2 stars \n",

      "This Uniden phone/answering system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago.  Here's a list of the other things about this phone that I like most1.  The corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off.  This along with price was the main reason I bought this phone system.  This feature is unusual for a cordless phone system.2.  The controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you don't have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording.3.  Also the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week sometimes more.5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.However there is something about this phone system that I don't like.The cordless handset has a pretty limited range.  I had to locate the base unit in a central location in my 2300 square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms.But overall I think the phone is a good buy if you can live with the distance restrictions of the cordless handset \n",
      "Very effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone I have. Sound is ok for what it does. However in a moving vehicle it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noisecancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noisecancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music the intruding noise is over. Otherwise no complains \n",
      "I was debating over the PictureMate Kodak Printer Dock 3 Sony DDPFP50 and the HP Photosmart 475. I made the choice of the HP and I LOVE IT The prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints. I use the HP 4x6 boarderless Premium Plus photo paper with the HP Ink and the prints are just wonderful. Forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all. (...) The HP produces bright vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime. The PictureMate is also alot larger than the HP 475. The 1.5GB hard drive is a plus as well. HP said that the remote is not included but they lied they come with the remote and battery. Overall this printer is the best I have own \n",
      "These DVDs are absolutely top quality and you really need to use bad DVDs to know how bad they can get.  I ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far.  Not a single coaster and Nero data verification (I always do that for DVDs) has not brought up any errors ever.  BTW the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files.  The burner is the DVD multi drive on my Dell Inspiron Laptop (1505).However I should mention (to those who haven't bought this product) why they are called Shiny Silver.  You know that print on the top of DVDs with lines and that matte finish?  Well there's no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I'm talking about No special surface however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.  Huge cost cutting here I guess but definitely not in the quality department.  I will buy again \n",
      "I burn a ton of DVDs and have used almost every brand out there.  Many have errors even the top brand names like Memorex...etc.I have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting.  I've switched all DVD media purchases to Verbatim.  They are by far the best of them all.  Would recommend to everyone \n",
      "First off these puppies sound good However there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should knowThe sound is loud and crisp but definetely midtrebley as with most inear headphones. The low end is there but for full effect it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves this sweet spot is not very wide. That said however I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bassrich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason i didn't give it five stars.Also the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) &amp RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn't realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.Riding while using them can be dangerous since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. Bang for the buck ( I paid $69.99 on amazon) I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados. \n",

I choose this one for the better deal and to add to my surprise J&ampR Electronics shipped it so quickly(You guys Rock). This one comes par with sony memory media in every field. So why choose the one with lesser memory capacity. Choose this one and feed your camera with some memory space \n",
      "Delivered on time no problems setting it up (just followed the instructions to format it because I didn't want the default format it comes with which is less safe). It's been running fine ever since I bought it. I can't comment on the speed of access because since I leave it backing up over night I don't really care. It's all done in the morning anyway so I don't really need anything faster \n",
      "I like this unit. It is hooked up to an SVideo in from my Digital Cable Box and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV. Picture quality is very good I'm very used to my highquality Sony DVD player DVPNS700P but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box but then I've not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program deleted it and then recorded again it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy anyhow. All told I'd recommend this DVD recorder without hesitation \n",
      "I don't normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can't go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that stepbystep for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn't wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the onscreen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers It will play mp3s CDs computer made DivX movies Region 1 DVDs Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer's codes which they list in a handy guide.  If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won't be disappointed \n",
      "I bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk...I WAS TOTALLY WRONG These are great they give the bass right where you want it. Sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much. Watch out these come on sale instores for around $8.00 sometimes. That's where i got my 1st pair \n",
      "The sound range and clarity is quite good they are comfortable. My only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes I'd like to use it with my computer not a MP3 attached to my belt \n",
      "I got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which in my opinion was a big mistake on Apple's part) and I absolutely love it Mine is pink and the color is so nice the design sleek and seamless all around. It's smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.It holds a little less than 1000 songs due to different formatting but it's still a good amount iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs raher than as on my brother's mp3 player needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine and does it's job my one complaint on that would be that as I mainly use it on the bus at 600 am it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod \"family\" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case an iSkin which I have come to adore high quality headphones and the iBass which is another great speaker product for ipods. I've actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself but that's how much I love itFor having so many great features this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200 I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW it's amazing     \n"

      "I haven't written any reviews for Amazon before but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball I had to respond.  I've been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90's when Kensington first came out with the \"Turbo Mouse\".  It was great then and now it's better.  This is as solid smooth and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don't understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand  your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price but frankly it's worth that.  It's a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.  If you need (or want) a high performance trackball that you'll be able to use with many computers to come get this one \n",
      "These speakers are awesome for the price.  They charge your ipod even when the unit is off.  The sound quality is great for around 50 bucks.

      "I work for a small sized consulting engineer's firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text (magazine articles old projects letters from the client books etc).We got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner ( still working ) and we have been impressed with its speed small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality PDF files.A couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them.PROS  incredibly easy to use ( you don't need to teach anybody ) fast for PDF scanning great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled ) very small perfect for a desk good construction quality no one of our 4 scanners ever brokeCONS  quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams doublefeeding that some time occurs. not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ).I strongly suggest it for smallmedium sized businesses to scan documents.If you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better.  \n",

      "These are some great headphones with a few minor flawsPros1. Great sound quality2. Very comfortable3. Light4. Worryfree chargingCons1. Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy could require pressing the tunein button several times2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)My experience I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So overall wonderful product. However there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this you have to press the only button (power search and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well I hope my description is helpful. Regardless of the flaws I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep.  \n",
      "I have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system this MUST be taken into account.    First off this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bidirectional midrange speakers the subwoofer unit and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white silver black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any soundgranted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong toa very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  Since I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver but when that was all said and done I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tagits target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  My test soundtracks included  Gladiator Matrix (II or III) Snatch and music tracks ranging from techno rock classical and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low high and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  All in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.Good  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy setup.  Well built speakersaesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.Bad  Subwoofer awkward no dedicated center channel pricey no included receiver.For their size these speakers more than compete with any fullblown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer \n",
      "Ladies and GentlemenJust a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy 'toys' before exploring what it is that they're buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is thata The U3 software has a way of stopping the software's autoboot.b There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com and I'm guessing that those company's that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the 'Uninstaller' on their site.c There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and payforit) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site so do Verbatim &amp Memorex.d For those who want portable software but don't want U3 or don't have a U3 drive go to http//portableapps.com.  Note some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks without using the U3 LaunchPad.e Quality of drives remember that when you buy most of the electronics 'toys' available today you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods also selling with NoName labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC and the destruction of goods that don't meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life ya gets whats ya pay for.g Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0 et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent 'rollback' feature.  And also the reason many if not MOST power users run multiple machines.  Of course these days we have to fill Billy G's pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my poweruser friends run at least three or four machines each one with a different use.  It shouldn't be this way but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software for many purposes (MP3's scanning Video controlling radios composing music et al) one machine won't cut it because XP ain't as stable as folks think.  The more programs and the more varied in type the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003 because there are less software 'toys' that run under 2K and the 'admin' can prevent you from loading a lot of software 'toys'.h In the end understand what you are buying before you buy so that you'll have better luck getting what you want and you won't look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong or just plain stupid.i When you truly understand the product you'll be able to write TRULY useful reviews and that what all readers want useful information.To one and all may your 'toys' keep you happy \n",

      "I purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house. To start I bought only one additional phone. I'll buy the rest later. So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that I have found very useful. Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.You can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the \"Living Rm\" rather than phone #3 etc.If you have caller ID you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn't transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. Also on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say \"home\" etc. On this phone the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. I think the phone is great I just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature. \n",

      "I recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. The E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. I am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. I also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.My biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes not as good as the E20s but still very good. As I write I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan the BPO and AnneSophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volumepretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. I bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response and I liked the Advents Over time our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded \n",

      "This is an affordable option that provides a lot of memory and allows USB 2.0 protocol for very fast transfer. If you need to transfer data from one digital product to another this is very handy and I think that every person dealing a lot with data should have one. \n",
      "I basically bought these because they were cheap. Cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example. The UR20 provides excellent sound for both music and movies. It has excellent bass and sound isolation. I am by no means an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it and these headphones produce great sound especially for its price. \n",
      "Not a bad battery deal. While they don't last as long as some other batteries I've tried their cost per battery more than makes up for it. For those that care about such things they contain no mercury no cadmium and are made in China \n",
      "I've had this keyboard a number of years and would never go back to anything else. I have (or had) severe carpal tunnel syndrom. This keyboard has eliminated that problem entirely. I can't think of a downside. Yes it takes a bit of getting used to and yes the keys are a bit noisy. But I have no problem with that. It just reminds me I'm working.The number pad is excellent too.I'm getting ready to get another one to use with my laptop.You can't destroy this keyboard. If you value your wrists and hands get this \n",
      "We previously had an AT&ampT cordless w/answering machine (1 handset) and always had trouble locating the one receiver  kind of like misplacing the TV remote. With 3 handsets we are spoiled. Also our house has a few phone jacks but they are all located where we did not want a phone and no jacks in our den or living room. With the abilty to locate the phones anywhere in the house where there is an outlet we were able to place one in our living room and another in our bedroom (which we can turn the ringer off). \n",
      "Corded phones with features are becoming harder to find nowadays.  My home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages mobile phone down for whatever reason etc.  This is one of the few corded phones with caller ID and no answering machine built in.  The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless etc.  Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen.  Highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house \n",
      "Wow who would've thought that you could get such amazing products at affordable prices.  The staff's friendly and responds quickly to any questions that you may have.  This is one amazing phone system (Uniden TCX905) I forgot that it's a cordless.  \n",
      "Bought this for my son who is in Iraq. He doesn't leave his tent w/o itStands up fine to the dust and heat with no problem. Has more room than he expected. The price was LESS than the smaller one he wanted from a competitor to Amazon.com.SO glad I found this one on Amazon instead \n",
      "I'm going to cover compatiblity sound and comfort.OVERVIEW.Although I wish these were as cheap as the IPOD $39 + $6 shipping isnt bad either. I have done the heat treatment (using boiling water) and the headphones seemed to open up more. When the headphones came in the box the ear pieces were really close together. So I can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head.I plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more.SOUND.Sound quality is excellent.COMFORT.The only thing I don't really like is this style of headphone. I don't really like the band to go around the back of my head causing my ears to support the headphones. I like the ones that go over the top of your head.COMPATIBILITY.I have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter. These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes (PSP also) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord.FEATURES.Coolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls About 3X feet away \n",
      "I am overall quite pleased with these headphones.  The sound quality is excellent.  I've not had any problems with interference background hiss or anything of that nature.Battery life has been excellent.  I have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they'll last but I use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they haven't failed me yet.The only reason I would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use.  I'm not really a big fan of this \"sport\" style of headphone and probably wouldn't have tried these if I hadn't gotten them on clearance.  But I found that after experimenting a little I was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable even wearing them the better part of a workday \n",
      "The keyboard is good quality and the best product I could find for the price. I recommend if you are looking for a low profile keyboard w/numeric entry pad that takes a mimimum anount of desk space.  The keypad has the feel of a large notebook computer.  So makes a great docking station keyboard if you are used to the slim kepads on most modern laptop computers. \n"

      "First off let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors three Samsung models two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic but for my taste and needs the Samsungs are simply too bright and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light daytime use I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.Installation was simple in fact something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that interestingly again the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on I truly do not think the picture was as clear or the graphics as rich as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But and this is another tip for new users of this product the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal if not fully equal to those on the other LCDs that I own.One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics).  And especially with the digital connection I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones  This is a really a fine monitorNow for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven't purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because while there are speakers they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example on the 17 inch Samsung monitor the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It's not bad but it's going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails other monitor stands are available.As with most electronic products these days there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard selfexplanatory things.  However I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer's website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems surprisingly.All in all I'm very impressed so far and I'm really looking forward to using this monitor  By the by shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast it shipped the next day and it arrived the day after that.  I can't complain about that speed  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure  Anyway a solid four stars for this monitor \n",
      "I'm using this AP along with a Netgear 802.11g PC Card to test streaming live/recorded TV to other parts of my house.  Seems like a capable product even if I didn't use the 108Mbps feature.However be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network's DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.I noticed that there is are hordes of wireless APs around my house I guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well.  However this DLink AP is able to function correctly abeit all the other APs around (2 using the same channel as mine I've found).Overall recommended if you want a good AP.  Just be sure to update the firmware \n",
      "The sound quality is pretty darn good except that if you pace around while talking/listening there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite and if you stand still they go away.  I've had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking  at least this phone doesn't do that.  My 900 MHz DSS Uniden didn't have these sounds (while pacing or otherwise) and still had greater range.  I don't know why the new technology can't measure up.  Still though this is the best 5.8 I've tried.  (Yet I'd rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore.  All of today's 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)Another annoying thing is that you can't recharge the phone with the belt clip attached so the clip goes on and off (and on and off).  (Many (cell) phones have a charger that allows this.)The plastic is a bit cheap.  Don't drop this phone.  My friend has one and it hasn't worked since it was dropped.(I haven't tried the bluetooth yet and have yet to see how good the battery life is. \n",
      "I got this base and added 6 TCX805 handsets to it.  The whole setup works great.  I got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone.  That features works well there's a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that's trivial.  I will say this you need to keep your cell phone within about 20' of this base.  I just take mine off turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.So if you want the cell dialing feature and like the more traditional upright handset get this base and expand it with other handsets.  \n",
      "This product is great  allowed me to connect a distant printer to my computer by hooking two of the extension cables together.  Worked right away  no problems \n",
      "This is a great headset for my use.  It is very clear.  I use it for work and I only make use it periodically throughout the day making about 10 calls daily so I don't wear it all the time \n",
      "Researched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money this one was hands down the best 32\" LCD.   Also Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   I mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all after owning the tv for about 2 months now I couldn't be happier.   To get around the poor speakers I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  I've also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42\" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There's also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  The only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can't use the PIP with the cable connected only the antenna.   \n",
      "I had a Zen VisionM but I returned it because I decided I didn't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player so I decided to go with the Zen V since it's interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M's(which I liked).The first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn't that impressed but it's really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.The music is organized your standard ArtistAlbumSong interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still it's as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hitormiss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  The player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer album art will not be attached to the music tracks.If you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bitrate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player half as much as advertised.  SummaryProsExcellent physical designEasy to use interfaceGood navigationGreat sound qualityConsOnthego playlist creation is flawedAlbum art support hitormissSlow transfer speeds from WMP11Accesories rarely available in brickandmortar storesUltimately I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it's vastly superior physical design.  \n",
      "I have had these speakers for over a month and I love them they sound awesome. They were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described \n",
      "I read the other reviews for these speakers so I had very high expectations. I can only say WOW The premium price (compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems) is absolutely justified \n",
      "For reference I've owned a set of Labtec APX6420 2.1 speakers for about 67 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers I recall sampling Altec Lansing Logitech Klipsch Bose Creative and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.I initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1's because of the fantastic reviews they've gotten on Amazon and elsewhere but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly) along with reports of buzzing the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer my impression of them in stores and experience with a friend's ProMedia 4.1's (which neither I nor him really cared for and which recently broke).I tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z5500's which I own and love) The bass especially sucks on their speakers.So... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so it had to be the FX6021's which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they're probably worth it. These speakers a very niceThe sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno though that sounds good too).Subwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It's very deep rich and discrete. Doesn't shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complainyes I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass maybe you shouldn't have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective but those reviews just don't sound right to me.PROs* Tall sleek and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.* Power button on control pod* This is important NO BUZZING. Not while they're on not while they off. 100% silent.CONs* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\" these notches aren't always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.* Remote is a bit useless* While they look good and perform well they feel a little cheap* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand long cables are a PRO as well)And finally don't be fooled by specs. Yes other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification but that really doesn't matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn't pay any attention to the specs I bought them because they sound the best \n",
      "I've owned these Altec's for over three years now and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them  as a matter of fact when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer I went ahead and still purchased these babiesSOUND QUALITY  the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall  I have used mine for video editing and I'm very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through in addition to the special effects sound  unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I'm confident that this is the most crisp sound you'll find in any speakerVOLUME  these suckers can get LOUD  just take my word for itCOMPATIBILITY  This is the part I love most  there is no software to install and no special plugs  the speakers plug right in and very easily into the audio jack just like a pair of headphones would  thus hooking in a computer iPod cdplayer etc is easy as heck making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipmentCONTROLS  the speaker system comes with a seperate remote giving one access to adjust the volume bass and treble all seperately from the computer's controls  the knob to control the volume and other functions is easy to use and makes for quick adjustmentsSIZE  the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size  placing these speakers is easyPRICE  believe me  it's a bargain at under $200Overall I give my full recommendation here  you'll love these speakers \n"

      "My sound improvement wasn't as dramatic as many people describe likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock pop blues or jazz this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3's though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo I'm not sure if this card will do much for the sound but it might \n",
      "I wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $60.  I kept thinking what could be so special about it.  Well I don't know where to begin.  I like it so much I'm getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I'd never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn't care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That's not why I got it although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming I really didn't notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.My only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks \"homemade\".I would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a PC \n",
      "I got the Razor Diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it's performance.  For gaming it's great but I do not recommended it for everyday mousing around. The resolution on the Diamondback was the selling point for me and if that's something your interested in you will NOT be disappointed.  It's really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it's design but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked  Oh it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.Design problems that I have noticed... Buttons squeak button placement is not optimal it's kinda small for people with big hands programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement. If you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse highly recommended \n",
      "I decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the \"g\" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.  Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet over the last 5 hours.The reason I took away one star is the fact on the Wireless Network Monitor V2.1 there seems to be a flaw.

      "I recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY Lexar DaneElec etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no writespeed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the readspeed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So if a little longer read time is not a problem for you then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall a very good standard SD card at an excellent price      \n",

      "I bought this package purely for the keyboard. I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together however.The keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home end page up page down and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven't gotten used to but it's fine.I have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I've experienced no problems here it's spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem really is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however there are no problems at all.I do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had builtin bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don't use the mouse very much but the times I do use it I experience no problems.Both the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.The battery life on the keyboard is also very nice esspecially since it has the builtin sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet but I do not use it very much.Others complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens but I haven't had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.I highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way you cannot go wrong with this package it is extremely excellent \n",

      "Bottom line up frontWorks very well very low price works much better with the included drivers than with the generic windows xp driverDetailed reviewI bought this so I could use my new Treo 700w with my nonbluetoothenabled laptop.  The price was my main motivation in buying it.Initially I just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay however it didn't always work and i'd have to unplug/replug for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other.After getting tired of that I decided to install the drivers that ship with the product.  I've had a much better experience since i did that.  I was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price but it's actually quite good and gives you a TON of options that the standard XP driver does not provide.If you use a this with a laptop and you dock/undock it you'll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to docking/undocking.  Otherwise you'll probably end up having to unplug/replug it \n",

There are also line up/down buttonw above and below the scroll wheel that allow for more control in scrolling.The scroll wheel feel good better than some other mice I have used.I opted to use the native Windows XP mouse driver so the application button does not work but the Windows taskbar is not much of a hardship ) and I prefer not to clutter up my system with another set of marginal utility software \n",

      "I purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you'll know when they're calling without picking up the handset.Talking caller ID is great too. No more rushing to find the phone only to discover it's a sales pitch or a call that could wait.I set this phone up on a voice over IP cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear. The phone is running next to an 802.11b/g wireless computer network and has NO interference at all. One suggestion to make the batteries last longer Do NOT leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time. This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays \"recharge\" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You'll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so \n"

      "I was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when I ran across these on a website. I was a little hesitant at first because I don't think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don't let the breaking in period discourage you After these become comfortable you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.I started with all my heavy bass tracks and couldn't believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumpsIf you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you. If you are just a casual music listener I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these I would have paid much more than I actually did \n",
      "This is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don't think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.On the bright side however the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I've ever used the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB's ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\") drum n' bass and many types of rap/hiphop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall opinions will vary. With rock music for example the strong bass is certainly a plus but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly and some detail is lost.It should be noted that this bassdominated sound signature renders the EB's a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. In terms of build the EB's superficially seem wellconstructed and designed. I have heard complaints however that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there Thoughtfully EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM's (including foam flanged and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB's don't extend deeply into the ear canal which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal comfort is good and isolation decent. However if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB's.Oh and some people think that the EB's look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higherpriced Super fi 5 Pro model the EB's stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.Like all of the UE IEM's in this series the EB's are packaged with a nice set of accessories including a 1/4\" adapter plug a sound attenuator a soft travel case an earwax loop and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM's cord tangling.It's unlikely that the EB's will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bassdominant types of music. The truth is however that even for bassheavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bassy music the EB's are welldesigned and definitely fun \n",
      "we have this for our 30gb ipod and it works fine in both our cars.....very handy and a must buy \n",
      "This is the 2nd Gamepad I've owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4button + DPad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted etc.I love this controller.  I've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I've only used it in NFS games (I have them all).The WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.The rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFSMW is very slight but that's not the controllers fault it's a matter of programming by EA Games.I like the weight of the controller.  It's not feather light so with that motor and battery weight added it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it  canadian dollars).  I didn't like how my gravis gamepad as so light so this is a step up.The analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for nonslip action.  I am used to the DPad so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don't have time during a race to press a button before switching.It works as well as my old gamepad but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA you'll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.CONSIt's not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.CONCLUSIONI'm very satisfied overall and I knew I may have to get used to the way it feels when I hold this controller since changing from the old SNES style Gravis Gamepad.4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold \n",
      "We have had this phone for almost a year and I love it. We have the base station which is also an answereing machine  plus we have  a sattelite phone.  I wish we had more satelite phones.  I love the talking feature because I just listen and know who is calling. I also love the programming feature.  I never have to look aup a tel number that I call regularly anymore. I just wish the extra phones were not so expensive to add on. Great phone buy it \n",
      "The system worked out of the box allowing me to quickly link up additional devices in an inhome office which had a single network connection. Haven't measured simultaneous throughput to multiple computers yet but from simple observation connectivity seems transparent. Should allow for movement to gigabit switching in the future as well \n",
      "This cable is of the best quality quick shipment and at a price that beats all the retail stores  you can't go wrong \n",
      "I did buy a set of 2 \"Base station and extra handset\". Its a great design tons of features MP3 ring ton Picture Caller ID Sync with your PC for phone book Answering machine etc.I am very happy with.Thank you so much for such great product with a great price \n",
      "I work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words I don't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don't use speaker phone features. Let's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn't care less about.This phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and backlit buttons all look very slick.The screen is attractive. A big step up from backlit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.I like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute adjust volume and page through your caller history.The belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.I know many 5.8 GHz phones don't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don't know for sure if this phone falls into that category but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing's for sure this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.One other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.Finally I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use sitting it is dock the phone's screen displays the time.So far I've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I've owned \n",

      "I have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"overthehead\" headphones. I have tried all styles earbuds behind the neck clips even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted I have never tried the sportapros or portapros but from what I have read they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus you can't beat that price \n",

I would like the manufacuters to explain in detail how to attach the tread to the laniard. It took me a while to figure it out \n",
      "With so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus in my opinion this is about the sleakest and bestlooking unit out there (I went with black I'm not an Applewhite drone).  The sound is very very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit which I think is a good thing  it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.  Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes.  Power cord is plenty long and I like the fact I can easily move the thing to a different room if I need music there \n",
      "Well the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock.  Its VERY simple. just put your ipod on there and ROCK OUT TO THE BEAT. The bose quality is very obvious and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it which brings me to my next point. ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. my recomendation is to buy an FM transmitter and listend to your ipod on any Fm raido.  The only disadvantage of an Fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod and its slightly easier(but thats what iPod is all about isnt it...?)Basically im saying buy it if you have a lot of mone \n",
      "I'm a jogger and like to listen to All Things Considered while I run miles and miles. This radio is great because the light weight is unobtrusive.

      "I was devout in my belief that I could get similar photo output from my Canon S800 with less expensive paper.  I bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of Kodak's photo quality glossy from Costco.  My prints were blotchy.  Then I got my hands on some of Canon's Photo Paper Pro and my pictures were magically crystal clear.  The difference is amazing.  I never would've thought paper would make this much difference.  I've since bought Canon's 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don't care much about the quality of the output while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame \n",
      "This stick is fantastic for high resolution photos and is lightning quick. Do you need the extra speed the MSXM1GN gives you? Maybe maybe not. But at least you have it when and if you need the feature. Highly recommend it for the money.  \n"

      "Those people giving these speakers low reviews because they don't have enough bass are idiots.  I don't know what people expect of these little speakers but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do.  These are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels from Paris to camping in Northern California.  I cannot imagine going everywhere without them.  They are not  equivalent to a $10k stereo system but they are not meant to be.  All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers.  Do not listen to the other reviews these speakers will make a decent stereo of your MP3 player.  Enjoy them anywhere \n",
      "I have used VoSKY Skype Call Center (USB07051C01) for about a year now as my only home Skype In phone (paying $3.16 a month) after getting rid of Verizon (for which I was paying $50.00 a month).PROSIt works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone.Easy to set up.CONSOnce in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the Vosky software and start again.You need a computer.In summary good value for money and the best way to use Skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like Skype WiFi phones Netgear and Belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router \n",
      "Although I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever I will try to address the issue at hand and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.As far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn't give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though and I can't seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.So despite the downfalls that I mentioned above there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.  I simply love it I just wish those other issues never happened \n",

      "I'm a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no subwoofer) I decided for this notasportable model.Well these are perfect to keep on your desktop (though the ideal placement of any subwoofer is on the floor close to a corner) as it has a small sized subwoofer all controls in one the speakers.These speakers sound really nice slightly superior sound to Creative's corresponding model (SBS 350) but with less output power (Creative's SBS 350 subwoofer is larger and more powerful)Pros Headphone jack and POWER button in the left speaker No \"wired remote\" (which adds more clutter to your desktop) Nice design for the price Even cheaper than Creative's SBS 350Cons Small subwoofer No \"wired remote\" which means you have to keep one of the speakers close. No bass control (which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control \n",

      "I have the Quest 2 but I've heard that this also fits the Quest. I bought it because while my Dell laptop backpack is well padded I wanted to make sure that my Quest 2 GPS was protected \"just in case\". This case fits perfectly literally like a glove. When I got it I was sceptical it looked to small but I was wrong the dimensions are perfect. And there is more than enough padding to protect the GPS from harm yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket which I sometimes have to (late day meetings where I leave my backpack at work). All in all it's another great product from Garmin \n",

They are a little noisy but the horses don't care \n",
      "I purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount.  I don't know what the \"feet\" of the base is made of but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket  it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it'll stay there.  Occasionally on long or \"bouncy\" trips it'll creep out of position a couple inches and I'll have to move it back.  I've seen some comments complaining of that  but I don't see it as a problem since common sense says it won't stay perfectly still since it isn't bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.My wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS  I don't recommend she take the mount though  since the thing must way at least a couple pounds  too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion \n",
      "I got the dash mount because a friend recommended it.  I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to \"mold\" to fit the surface of the dash.  However it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.  Anyway it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when I stop thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber \n",
      "This is my first HOTAS but I did a good bit of research.  It is very easy to set up and the SST Programming is very helpful setting the shift key.

The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set.

So I get my new Extender kit unbox it and plug everything in without bothering to read the directions. Lets be real this stuff SHOULD be plug and play and IT WAS. It came right up and worked and has worked for the past three months flawlessly. I have decent range downstairs it works with the Macs and the PCs and doesnt seem to care a whit.

When the paper ran out I looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive  on the order of 40 cents per page.  Since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a lettersized sheet of paper that comes to about 20 cents per print not counting the cost of ink.  Finally I stumbled upon this paper  Epson S041727  and the price per print was around 12 cents which rivals the cheapest Internet photo printing services I've found.If you print a lot of 4x6 pictures this is a great value for a great product \n",

It even comes with a mouse if you prefer to use that instead of the pen. Plugs right into your USB drive and works almost instantly \n",

I even use it to read by simply sitting it on its back on my lap as I read in bed and pointing the lamp at my book.  It's too bad the lamp's arm isn't telescopic or it'd make for a perfectly good clipon booklight right out of the box.This device is well built folds into a form that protects it from damage even when thrown in a laptop case full of stuff that might crush something built less solidly.  And it has a nice retracting USB cable.  The retraction device for the cable like most I've seen on devices like this can be a bit finnicky but with the right pulling technique works correctly about 90% of the time.Update May 2005.  The light died.  No idea why.  So maybe it's not as good as I thought.   \n",

      "Let's just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD's the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn't need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I'm sure 1000 songs will hold me. I looked all over at prices and Amazon wins The free shipping is a great bonus also.The case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL \n",
      "I had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music with many errors not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features but the bad far far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over and many people returning them. I got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected I really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way I already have all the songs I like at my fingertipsI think these headphones really make this nano great I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play For something so tiny it rocks I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have \n",
      "Well the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price and Amazon.com has beaten every online price I have seen. As for the toner itself Hewlett Packard toner is top. I buy this product for two  reasons 1. It's what fits in my printer and 2. I know when I buy the  C3906A I am getting what I payed for a quality cartrige that lasts. One  last note twords the end of the cartrige life a small line appears in the  content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply  shake the cartrige reorder and by the time the new one arrives the old  one is finished \n",
      "I'm not much of a techie.  But I do have lots of documents and pictures that I can't bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day.  I used to back up my most important files on CD an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple CDs and lots of time.  But with this 2GB flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize.  The files are copied over to the device quickly and easily.The 2 Gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive.  ScanDisk even includes a \"Synch\" software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data.  (The software also helps you copy over your Outlook messages folders appointments tasks and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive.)  Also I can imagine that the use of the Synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine.Physically the unit is small sleek with a case that feels substantial.  The retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use.  This thing is great.  I only wish I'd started using it sooner.  \n",

      "I have some decent mics in my cabinet as well as a nice preamp A/D converter and fire wire interface for my home multitracking setup.  I wasn't expecting as good or better quality than I can already get but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to but for $79 I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft NTrack Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.  Way to go Samson \n",

      "The 6500B was the last one I tried of three.  I've had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a twoline phone that wasn't 2.4Ghz.The first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no builtin ans mach)  which is fine  but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stuttertone so didn't know there were any new messages  arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. Next I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It's a 2line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it's simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But it's answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn't have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such  all good.  But if I got home say and listened to a message for my wife the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We're so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it's not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an autolineselection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a nonbusy outgoing line.  But that would have messed up their simpler style button function  hmmm.The Panasonic I am surprised to say ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic's phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily this phone sets its date/time from callerid info even though the manual implies it wouldn't work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busyforward) it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what  just pick up and talk.The 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It's much lighter than earlier callerid handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets  I would like 6 or 7.  Also can't name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number \n",

      "This isn't my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don't underestimate this if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems even win98. The sound quality is good I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use onehanded.An unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks If you turn off the player it starts back up exactly where you left it be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter Its small without being too tiny its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heartattack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature but if you need to carry more than an album or 2 or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway. The best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.This would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. I'm giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle \n",

      "How many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  The SanDisk SDSDB128A10 Secure Digital 128MB like most 128MB cards will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs \n",
      "If you buy this service plan print out the contract (found at the top of this page) and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.Some notes on the contract1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington DC but MINUS MAINE) but it does not include Guam Virgin Islands etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C. this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is if the manu. warranty is still good you have to use it.4. If the item needs to be shipped shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect and a upon the time of a 4th repair as determined by them they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you  many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans (such as they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But in all seriousness read the list before you purchase.So now that I have summarized much of the contract if you want to get the service warranty PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also I think this is typical in warranty contracts but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product being at the lower price end of the scale) \n",

It makes what I bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies. I had no problems loading software and maps upload or download from/to my gps.I am impressed by the softwares ability to \"recalculate\" in navigation mode. If I ignore the suggested route it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where I am.I am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc. are concerned but I am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained.

      "As the title states this is an excellent wireless mouse.  Works right away with Windows XP no driver install or software needed for twobutton and normal scroll capabilities.  Software allows for extra button assignment but could use some work.  I have had some trouble finding the menus I want when I want to find them.  For example I have an issue where I cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the USB receiver after a system startup however I am able to find those menus in the software if I remove and reinsert the receiver.But as I said before superb mouse function and tracking...this thing works on upholstery leather my jeans and thick carpet \n"

      "The V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse but when it comes to the notebook it doesn't get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand if you can to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly then that is it game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers. \n",
      "When I purchased this product I was a little sceptical however once I unpacked it and started using it it was so absolutely easy to use and the pictures have such a fine quality and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection.  So I see it as a win/win product.  The only draw back is the weight and size. I just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel \n",
      "First and foremostI am not an audiophile so I can't comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habitsI find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.That being said what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.So why four stars?  Well for a few reasonsOnly available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I'd have liked to match it.No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn't disconnect so easily from the Nano that I'd fear it might fall off while walking about I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.For this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercisebut hanging loose around the neck really isn't the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\" so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit  Regardless there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.All in all I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free and that was what I was looking for \n",

      "The Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them they'll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile I've been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums but I've always been satisfied with merely \"decent\" audio.  Until now.I'd previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps but that's now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it's time to rip everything into lossless format.I cannot recommend these headphones more highly  they are simply extraordinary.  When your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality though life's going to get a lot more expensive as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation.Still this is a bloody miracle.  My ears have finally been opened.  Wow \n",
      "Having been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.Each time buying a Sennheiser product I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD600's I had just come away from years owning the HD25. When these encountered a technical problem I replaced them with a backup choice the HD25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. Whether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure or for studio work the accuracy of their sound and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt) and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded how good your system is and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.The reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade) is down to what HD600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums HD600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. It gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG RAM DOUBLE FANTASY MILK AND HONEY and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.When you listen to your CD's vinyl DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are the room dictates what you hear no matter what you've spent on speakers power amps woofers subdividers etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting high ceilings low ceilings plaster or cement wood floors a more long than wide room it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard how they were recorded and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers McCartney's JET sounds quite full though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD600's the drums nearly become nonexistent and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. Can I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I'm trying to prove a point doesn't it.Albums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD600's. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70's and 80's when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs that are all HD600 friendlyIsao Tomita's The Firebird (1976)George Harrison's eponymous album (1979)Steely Dan's Gaucho (1980)Joe Walsh's The Smoker You Drink The Player You Get (1973)10CC's The Original Soundtrack (1975)Godley &amp Creme's Consequences (1977)Supertramp's Crime of the Century (1974)XTC's Black Sea (1980)Peter Gabriel's 3rd album (1980)Kate Bush's The Dreaming (1982)Earth Wind and Fire's All 'n' All (1977)Level 42's The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)Billy Cobham's Spectrum (1972)Frank Zappa's One Size Fits All (1975)Ringo Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974)and a truly incredible sounding album from the 90's Prince and The New Power Generation's ''Symbol'' album from 1992.Albums NOT HD600 friendlyTodd Rundgren's Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)Blue Oyster Cult's Agents of Fortune (1976)Paul McCartney's Venus and Mars (1975  and quite a few others)John Lennon's Imagine (1971  and avoid 1970's Instant Karma like the plague the piano track will hurt you . .  )Yes's Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)and surprisingly enough many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain't broken.  If you have to save up for a pair or do some heavy searching for HD600's that are affordable do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed especially when I kept up with their pace. \n",
      "I just purchased one of these and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews that stated how difficult it was to load the information into the unit. I had no problem at all.

      "I was mislead with Amazon review which said it supports conversion to MP3 format with the software supplied it does not. The help quite clearly states \"You cannot convert a file into an MP3 file\". It will convert to .wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to MP3.If it had MP3 support (at least conversion on the PC from the Sony proprietary format which is .msv) I would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible. It you record in full quality mode (1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing. The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.But it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion. Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space.But I would buy one again as it is very easy to use small and very high quality. I just hope Sony would listen to consumers and support MP3 \n",

      "Before I bought this device I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was I didn't like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.It was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer I simply unplug the USB.  It's very simple.I am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn't fancy) this does not cause diminished sound quality so I'm perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.If you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo check for two things.  First your stereo has to have a set of two holes sidebyside that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I'm sorry I do not know the technical names for these things but there's a picture of the redandwhite plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer's \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside be sure to check your player for these two things.Overall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product \n",
      "The HP12C has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years. I bought my first one when I was a consultant and it lasted until August 2006. It withstood all the travel and constant use well. I use it for simple and complex math statistical analysis and financial analysis. It is much faster and simpler to operate than a PC. My new one has all the same great features. I highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis. \n",
      "I bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works it works beautifully. When it doesn't work it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse. Another nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control \n",
      "This is a great printer.  I have used it several times and it makes great pictures.  I had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great.  Tried this on a regular printer and the print didn't look near as great.  A great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have.  You can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards.Colors are great and vivid.  Also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop.  I have not tried printing to non Epson paper so I can't say how prints would look.  I know that Epson printers look the best printed on Epson paper.  \n",

      "I love this keyboard. After searching through just about every keyboard available I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I'm so glad that I chose this one.It is excellent The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It's a great keyboard for gaming office use media or just ordinary everyday use.They keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool but I don't use it much. It's better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though.I really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files email or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don't like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can't see any way to reasign it. However it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard.Aside from all of that how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it.To top it off it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability \n",
      "I have been into MP3s since 1996  I used winplay and l3enc and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere  Africa Europe My living room.  After about 70000 hours of use and abuse it finally died.  I needed a replacement so I looked at iPod and Zune but why would I stray from Creative Labs?  Besides it's better in every way  better screen than the ipod better interface than the Zune and a better battery than either one.When I plugged it into my computer I was blown away.  XP found the player and without any drivers or proprietary (think iTunes) software I was able to drop my nonDRM ) mp3 files right onto the generous space available.  I was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything or ever being forced to reboot my PC.  I transferred a couple of movies and I'm looking forward to my next flight \n",
      "This is my first time ever buying a really expensive MP3 player.  I bought it three weeks ago.  If I hadn't seen the Creative Zen VisionM I probably would have bought the Sandisk Sansa E260.  I love being able to bring my cartoon/tv shows over to a friends house so we can watch them on the tv.  There is one problem I've had with it.  I'm not sure if anyone else has had this but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger then I would've rated it a 5 \n",
      "Bought this DVD player 4 days ago and have enjoyed it ever since.  It has many features and a good picture. You can't beat the large screen. I like the zoom feature especially. Another feature I like is that the battery fits flush with the dvd player in back so that you don't have a bulky protrusion when it's attached.The sound is not loud as others have said but I have yet to find a portable DVD player that has good sound.  You'll have to use external speakers or ear phones(included). Another thing I notice is that DVDRW or DVD+/ R are not supported. They play but the menu system does not work. You have to access the file manually. That being said I cannot find this size dvd player anywhere else for less than $299.  The shipping was fast and free.  There is a stamp on the manual stating that the unit is sold \"asis\" but the unit I got was brand new and not refurbished. So far so good.  I don't thonk you will be disappointed \n",

Belkin.com's price is about $70 so my advice is to buy this unit now before somebody at Amazon wakes up  and jacks the price. \n",
      "I bought this recorder to use as backup for realtime event video recording.  I have also used it concert settings.  The record quality is astounding full range of dynamics using both the stereo miniplug input and the 1/4\" inputs.  It is mostly being used now to plug into sound boards to record long event audio.  First thing I did was to upgrade to a 4GB Compactflash card.  The provided card is too limited.Battery life is adequate for hour plus recordings and connection and downloading to PC is a breeze.  The WAV files are really high quality.It all works as advertised.  The only minor glitch I have had is that when you first try to start a recording it gives a \"media full\" message even tho the media is empty.  Then you select record again and it records just fine.  I went several iterations with Tech Support who were very friendly and helpful but the problem has not been resolved.  I also suspect the 3rd part flash card may be contributing to this glitch.  I would buy this recorder again \n",

I hooked everything up last light and turns it one.  OMG amazing my Yamaha receiver and Wharfdale Diamonds 8.2 no longer sounded muddy but insted bright and even toned the kick from the sub was tight no sloppy and precise it turned a good system into an eye opener.  The Sony progressive scan and LG plasma now are like looking at real people no a screen  the HD stiff is simply the best  digital cable it good and the dvd's are quite near HD.  All in all I would highly reccomend this to anyone.

Very little $$ more than the powerstrip design units I was looking at (&amp now I see it dropped even lower).Pros Build quality fit &amp finish plenty of outlets &amp diversity of outlets for me nice formfactor compared to powerstrip design cool looking LEDs &amp meter.Cons Those cool looking LEDs cannot be dimmed &amp are too bright (esp the blue one) if facing HT viewers.  I just blocked the LEDs w/a black card.  CABLE/SAT cable filtering no good for my digital cable provider (Cablevision)...

      "I was looking for something suitable to house my sansa and this fit the bill better than most. The leather case is superb looking sharp snug and protective. I enjoy the fact you can still easily access the buttons and menus through it. Both the leather case and the larger case have an atachee on the back if you wished to connect them to the cord that comes with it. The cleaning cloth works as well as any lense cloth great for cleaning. The screen protector is a pain in the rear to apply without bubbles still haven't figured out how yet and I may trim it to make it more visually appealing. But really if you invest in a product such as this it really makes sense to protect the easily scratched screen The larger case is compact and protective having a small storage area yet the cover is a bit unsightly because of the cheap generic looking Sansa logo. Only other complaint is that the leather case goes on a belt but not as a removable type. Only if you put it on when putting on the belt which can be impractical in some circumstances. This way I suppose it wouldn't be able to fall off \n",

      "While thinking of ideas for my church's 75th anniversary celebration I  decided to make Tshirts and sweatshirts using ironon transfers and my ink  jet printer. I chose the \"invent it\" brand from Hammermill  papers because it was the most costeffective (cheapest). I created the  design on my computer and tried it out on the transfer paper. The results  were outstanding for a doityourself project. I followed the instructions  included with the transfers and it was a piece of cake. One thing that I  did find out  keep the transfers dry after they have been printed. One got  wet in the rain and it spotted very badly wherever a rain drop came in  contact. This product also does a very good job in black and white not  just in color. The shirts that I did laundered according to the  instructions came out of the wash lookin' good. I won't hesitate to use  this product again in the future. However I am now having trouble buying  it locally since my previous source no longer handles this product \n",
      "We purchased the YSP1 in August as a companion to our Hitachi Ultravision wallmounted television.  What a fabulous piece of audio equipmentWhen we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wallmounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP1 set up in a room environment.  The other on the salesroom floor.  In both setups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however my husband felt the lowend sound could use enhancement.  So we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important and timeconsuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home I feel the lowend sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the subwoofer.  My husband though prefers the earthshaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall we both got what we wanted.  Expert sound designation and sleek minimalistic styling (with the added bonus of more floor and wall space).  \n",
      "You bought the IPOD Nano basically for its looks.  Buy this for the same reason.  Its so cute and fits your Nano exactly as you wish.  I bought an item from another company and though it was cheaper it looked dirty on my computer table.  This one has the \"Apple\" look \n",
      "I chose these by reading other reviews on Amazon.  I am pleased with them and recommend them. Good sound light weight.  The best feature is that they do NOT leak sound yet you can still hear loud noises around you.  This is perfect for an ipodusing NYC subway rider.   Don't want to annoy others by leaking sound but you have to be able to hear if there is exterior noise at least enough to know to turn down the sound and find out what's going on.Only con  Once you lose or wear out the removable spongy pieces I'm not sure where you can get replacements \n",
      "These ear buds are great for people with small ears.  I've tried several and these are by far the best.  It comes with 3 sizes of buds and the smallest work best for me \n",
      "This is a terrific phone.  It has a ton of great features and the three handsets is very convenient.  This is the only phone that I use now.  I only keep one analog phone for power outages.  If you're looking to clean up a little bit of phone clutter this is a great way to do it \n",
      "We are very satisfied with our purchase.  This phone system is great and very easy to use.  Super clarity volume etc.  Also super fast shipping from Amazon.  I chose Super Saver shipping and it arrived in less than 24 hours \n",
      "I saw the other reviews and was hoping I would have the same experience as the happy reviewers. Well I got the cam and it was easy to install like they say. It just takes a little tinkering with the PC options before you use it. With the mic and software it comes with you get a lot for your money If I bought a cam in the store I would have been mad to lose out on this PC camera. It is SWEET \n",

      "As soon as I bought this from Amazon the price went up from $21 to $ 37.  I was going to buy another one but the price is too high.  Overall this is a great product it has everything you need.  However I wouldn't buy it at the current price I'm waiting for the price to go down before I buy another one \n",

      "I tried all the rubber vinyl plugs that came with the E3C's but they all had the shortcoming of not effectively sealing the ear canal making bass very poor and they were uncomfortable.  The yellow foam plugs are easy to use and work just like the ear foams many people use in industrial applications.  They effectively seal the ear canal and are very comfortable.  Although they seem a bit expensive I've found that once they get dirty you can use water and a bit of dish detergent to clean them.  Just soak squeeze rinse and let them air dry and they are as good as new.  You can do this three or four times then just toss them away.  Highly recommended \n",
      "Once THE speaker of choice for every hard rockin' audiophile with a big enough garage Klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that didn't know the real value of what they'd bought.  But after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles Klipsch is back on top from a sound quality standpoint  and it shows in the ProMedia 2.1 THX.I have my trio connected to a new Mac Pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical.  Yes there are more complex setups with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room but if you just want the magic without the madness the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX is an incredible (and very affordable) solution that's quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes.Of course there are other 3speaker desktop systems by makers like Logitech Cyber Acoustics and Intec but here's the difference Klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers.  NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose Harman Kardon JBL and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3speaker sets both sound nasal and \"tinny\" on the high end while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great but are more expensive.  So after a good look (and listen) around I went with Klipsch.In any case this is an incredible sound setup for your computerbased music player and should not be overlooked.  Enjoy \n",
      "This splitter was setup as part of a configuration that splits one line from the street into three and then into sixteen ports and a line to the cable modem for a fraternity house. I used this brand of splitters and a moterola amplifier all the way through and the results were amazing. The picture quality is crystal clear even when almost all of the ports are in use and the internet is blazing fast. Compared to the setup we used to have with some cheap splitters and a radio shack amplifier these pieces are WELL WORTH THE SMALL EXTRA COST \n",
      "These cables are super with my new DVD player. There is absolutely no interference from my other home theater equipment. The picture is soo clear and vivid. The cables themselves are really made well they could hold up 100 pounds of weight no doubt. If you get these Monster cables you won't be sorry \n",
      "I previously had a 2.1 sound system for my computer that were pretty good a few years ago when I bought them.  When I decided to replace them with these I was rather happy with my choice.  The sound is extremely clear and crisp whether it be music or games and I am very pleased with them.  The only downside to them is how many extra cords there are behind my desk but you have to expect that with a 5.1 sound system \n",
      "I am glad I bought this backpack. It exceeded all my expectations. I strongly recommend this one \n",
      "These are really great. Super noise cancelling. Affordable. They cover my ears completely without problem. At first the headset was a bit tight so I stretched the top headband upwards a little to relax or slightly loosen it. No more problem while still having a snug fit. These headphones also fold up very compact have two plug adapters and a nice durable sack for storage.If you buy these just make sure they fit well for your ears. If so these are great if not try another type. Like all things that touch the body it is best to try at a local store before you buy it. This is the lowest price I have seen for this product. \n",
      "I am happy with my purchase.  I only bought it because I don't like the idea of going deaf listening to loud music through earphones.  I would not use this product to entertain at a party but it serves my needs \n",
      "On a recent trip I was 23 hours in transit and couldn't have made it without this little device. It powered my movies and TV shows for at least 12 hours or so without a flicker. I was worried that the four AA batteries would make it heavy to carry but it didn't matter when the device was sitting on my tray table. Besides it was comforting to know that AA batteries are ubiquitous throughout the world. By the way I substituted the original batteries with Duracells on the advice of previous reviewers \n",
      "I bought this battery pack for a 10 day trip to Italy and I am very happy with it. I never had to change my batteries once and I listened to it all the time. Reading other people's reviews I threw out the batteries it came with and used different ones and it worked great. The only complaint I have is the suction cups aren't that great. Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. Overall I recommend this product. It is a little bulky but if you're someone like me who cannot live without music it's a great product to have if you aren't going to be able to charge your Ipod \n",
      "I have seen many reviews about problem with the volume control.  I experienced the same thing until I realized that I mistaken the up &amp down buttons with the + &amp  buttons.  The volume works just fine on my wife's old Sony receiver.  The remote is quite nice and it does everything the iPod control could do.  As stated in others' reviews you can't read the screen from a distance thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.  However it would be worse if the remote couldn't scroll through menus.It is compatible with the latest video iPod.  I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers.  I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me.  I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.  Since I have this little gadget for my wife I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better.In summary this dock does a good job and the design is not bad.  The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote.  If you are looking for great sound quality I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock \n",
      "I'm really happy with this purchase. I was worried that it would not work with Rhapsody (which is the media player I use the most) but it proved to work well with it. In fact it works with all the media player I've thrown at it including Windows Media Player MediaLife RealPlayer iTunes Rhapsody DivX Player WinDVD and PowerDVD. All the buttons are functional (and I worship functionality  hence the 5 stars) although Firefox users have to deal with extra configuration steps to make the back and forward button work. No biggies though since setting up is really easy. Basically all you have to do is open the SetPoint software that was installed with the driver point to the intended buttons that you want to program and assign a corresponding keystroke to it. In this case it's Alt+Right for forward button and Alt+Left for back button. Click \"Apply\" and you're good to go abrowsin'Battery life so far is really good  it's been going on the same set of Duracell AA batteries since I got it 3 months ago and still going strong. The RF range is really good although admittedly my room isn't big enough to really put its range to the test. Dormdweller users should be happy with the range though. You could just lie on your bed and only lift one finger to control your music or movie.This mouse is also great looking not cheapplasticky but actually sharp and slick. It does feel a bit odd to the grip when using as a remote control but as a mouse it's really sturdy and ergonomic. I can't comment on installation since it's been a while since I first used it but I guess no impression is good impression  if it was troublesome I'm sure I'd remember.I'd second the other reviewer's gripe about how most cordless keyboards come with a mouse and this fantastic mouse doesn't come with a cordless keyboard... But it's a great buy all in all \n"

      "Until an accident caused one bud to stop emitting sound these were my favorite pair of earphones. They were comfortable (I often left them in when I went to sleep) affordable lightweight durable and had good sound quality. I used them with my Sony CFDV5 boombox my Oritron OP5034 portable CD player and my RCA RP2410 MP3CD player. On all three bass and detail was great and there was no distortion at a higher volume. All in all these earphones were a great value the only possible downside is a bit of fuzziness in the sound which I got used to rather quickly and began to prefer over my other earphones (it lent a bit of warmth to the music). I plan to buy another pair in the near future and I highly recommend that you do so as well \n",

      "I received it today and it's a monster.  If you've seen one in a store it looks twice as big on your desk.  Until a few hours ago I was running two 20\" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI are going for $600+ on ebay I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides I didn't feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).To my great relief the monitor worked on the card right away even showing me the POST and Windows startup screen (it did for the 20\" displays too).  But to my absolute delight the card is actually running both the 30\" and a 20\" in 32bit color.  The 20\" looks absurdly small next to the 30\" like I didn't water it enough or something.  The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved  Maybe I'm just sitting too close.The only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20\" plug to fit it below the 30\".  I'm not a gamer so I can't say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20\" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse Flash Photoshop etc. but no video editing or 3D stuff.The screen had a slight warm cast that I didn't like.  Nvidia's control panel let me adjust it manually and now my 30\" and 20\" look almost identical.  My biggest fear was of course dead pixels.  By the good grace of lucky ducks this is the third panel I've gotten from Apple with no dead pixels.  Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges.  It's not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it.In any case I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once and it does a fine job at that.  I'm using the 20\" for browsing and alas a few panels that STILL don't fit.  Apple where's 3840 x 2400??  I strip one star cuz it's crazy expensive. \n",

She was pleased with the accuracy and said it enabled her to travel around with confidence.  However she noted that Madrid was undergoing quite a bit of major road construction and she got stuck in multiple traffic jams on the major highways.  In the end she would veer away from the major roads and let the unit recalculate her route.  \n",
      "If you understand this product's limits before you buy it you'll be happy.  It shows topographical contours rivers and most streams for the entire United States.  In addition to that it shows roads that were in existance 1020 years ago.  These major roads are also named.The limit is that newer roads don't show up.  It also doesn't support autorouting even if your GPS does.  Garmin sells other products that are tailored for road navigation but you have to do some independant research or logical deduction to figure out that this package isn't suited for it.The product support could be better.  Neither the manual nor web site tell you how to load all 3 CDs on your computer so you don't have to swap CDs when transitioning between zones.  The company's web site doesn't give a good explanation of what the software can and can't do.You'll be disappointed if your expectations aren't grounded in reality.  Garmin could help alleviate this problem by making this information readily available \n",

I miscalculated how much wire I needed so my rear right speaker does not have the new speaker wire I can hear a light and day difference in sound quality. Needless to say I'm ordering more to complete the job. The monster fiber optic cable is a must as well. I can hear sounds that I normally couldn't on my old system. I like testing sound with The Hulk (the scene were he tears up the tanks) Saving Private Ryan (taking the beach) and Open Range (Gunfight at the end of the movie). In all these movies there are small sounds that you can distinctly hear now that I could not before the new wire and connectors. Excellent product \n",
      "This is my first mp3 player so I researched it carefully before making my decision. The gorgeous screen the wide number of codecs it supports and the 30gb hard drive were all selling points. I'm so glad I bought it. Videos look great on the screen. Some need to be converted over which is a slow process but in general I love it. The built in speaker doesn't do it justice. Even on the included earbuds the sounds quality is amazing. Making playlists with the creative software is very easy. My biggest problem is the lag of accessories for it. No case no screen protectors out for it. I'd love to see a docking station that lets you record to it as a dvr the way the archos players do. But for the money it looks to me to be a far superior player to the Ipod or the Zune. \n",

      "I did a lot of research on Amazon.com before I finally decided on this mouse.  I wanted to replace my (extremely) small Kensington USB mouse with a retractable cable.  At home I use a Wacom tablet.  Next month I am traveling abroad so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington.  Wireless was key for portability.  I also wanted something rechargeable and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out.I received it today and I'm on my first charge.  So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway). I have large but skinny hands.  Mouse is small but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers.  Of course convenience is not comparable to a fullsize mouse but if you want portability this is about the right size. I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4).  Excellent Bluetooth connection.  Also very good response very little delay.  Only reservation is for the scroll wheel which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling  this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position.  It is hard to explain but not a big issue for me.  USB charger works well.  The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat but becomes an otherwise fullsized mouse)  despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse. As mentioned by others installing the batteries is a challenge.  Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers.  Once I figured it out not so hard. Overall I don't seek perfection anyway so this mouse does the job adequately for me.  I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before so I'm more or less in awe \n",
      "This card has been working great for me so far after over a month of heavy use.  512 MB is more than enough space for anyone with a 5 MB or less camera assuming you transfer photos off your camera fairly regularly and are not shooting hundreds of photos at a time.  With the 1200x1600p setting I use on my camera most often this card holds over 400 photos and it will hold even more for those using a more emailfriendly setting.  Do the math to figure out if 512 is the number for you but I've had no problems with SanDisk products \n"

      "I have to admit I'm a GPS junkie.  I've had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3  the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving.I am greatly impressed with this unit.  It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance say 300+ miles from where it last thought it was it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case after the initial automatic recalibration the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.The user interface is very easy to use.  I've used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface.  I think Garmin's is better.One highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI) but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  This allows you to identify say hotels along your route while you are driving and then using the telephone info provided by the unit to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive  \"let your fingers do the walking...\"If you don't tell the unit where to look though it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn't know which city to specify and I did a search for \"Eagle Rock Rec\" (I was too lazy to spell out \"Eagle Rock Recreation Center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn't know the exact city the destination was in I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.The advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all InNOut Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the builtin POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher you can do the same with geocaches but you'll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.The newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive allowing signal acquisition indoors but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine  especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately ). I haven't tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point the c530 lacks the c340's texttospeech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).Since I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin's MapSource Topo mapping software I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked  So now I have the c340's excellent builtin maps and POIs for onroad trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for offroad adventures.One thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit's WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.Also since this unit has a touchscreen fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammoniabased product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens  it will cause them to fog.  Instead use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don't use them for cleaning your touchscreen they might come in handy for firstaid.I give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it \n",
      "This paper works excellent in the hp series printers. I have tryed many other makes of Photo paper and they just don't cut it.

      "I've used this card for a while now and i'd say that i like it overall. the power usage is great. the drivers have been vastly improved and now you are able to scan for networks.

      "There's no need to take anybody else's word for specs on this Sony DVD player when you can view or download for free the user's manual at http//esupport.sony.com/US/perl/modeldocuments.pl?mdl=DVPNS90V&ampLOC=3. I've been running this Sony DVPNS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One for example states that there is \"no bass management\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user's manual) and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from 15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio or you think SACD's are tops is a matter of opinion taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I for one prefer DVDAudio and I mention this for an important reason Some product ads and the user's manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVDAudio discs.\" Happy surprize it most certainly will For my DVDA's that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks the player simply ignores the primary DVDA format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVDA's (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks) it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above the audio is full multichannel surround and not downmixed to 2channel PCM nor Prologic pseudosurround. The only DVDA function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVDA's and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and troubleshooters that it's bound to please even the highend audiovideo geekfreaks. In short you'll find this to be a superior universal player provided you read the user's manual (all 84 pages of it) follow it and connect equally highquality compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features \n",
      "...what it has that the xr55 does not HDMI dualamping of front mains now available during 5.1 playback one extra set of component inputs and allchannel stereo (called \"party mode\" on other receivers).  Otherwise the internal components are identical so expect similar performancein other words outstanding SQ when matched with the right speakers blows away all other receivers under five hundred bucks and most under a thousand.  See my lengthy review of the xr55 for more details.  Boutique audio shops do not want you to know about this product because it'd put them out of business...they make much higher margins selling you receivers costing several times this Panasonic's prices since their profits are usually a fixed percentage of the street price.  \n",
      "This is the second Brother HL2070N printer i\"ve owned. The first died during a storm and I forgot about electrical surges. The only negative on this printer is a slight curling of the pages. It is fast and reliable. The prints are crystal clear. I would recommend this product to everyone \n",
      "Much cheaper than other Sony machine.  Works fine  then again I wasn't looking for anything fancy.  Don't have problems with the speakerphone or message recording as the others did.  I like the dual keypads \n",
      "I've had my Epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent. I run exclusively on Linux (currently Gentoo) and the Linux support for this printer (using CUPS) is superb. All modes resolutions etc. are supported. I use this printer a lot for engineering work printing Bsize (tabloid) drawings and it works great for that.Like just about every review states this printer slurps ink like Homer Simpson slurps beer. Because I don't print many color photos this is not a problem for meif I was doing that I'd get the Niagara system other reviewers cite. I've researched the Niagara system and  it looks like a good deal for heavy users. My main complaint with this printerand the reason why it only gets four starsis the ease with which the heads clog up. This printer wants to be used constantly. If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the frontpanel control or in more extreme cases run the headunclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a spongesandpaperlike thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.Still for Bsized printing and highquality photos and considering how well supported it is under Linux there's not much else better out there \n"

      "Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing is a vey nice touch as well. However it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128 \n",
      "I ordered the 4 meter cable which was pictured with 24 pin connectors and received one with 18 pins.  Found out that the missing middle 6 pins are used to transmit audio which my monitor doesn't support anyway.  Originally the DVID specification allowed for both a video signal and an audio signal but most manufacturer's have only used the video portion.  If you need a DVID cable an 18 pin connector will most likely work since most devices won't process the audio signal anyway.  There are a few (very few) devices that do use all 24 pins but with the advent of HDMI nobody really makes them anymore \n",

While I am not an audiophile I do admire and expect good faithful sound reproduction and these speakers more than do the job.  I don't understand how the more expensive ones can do any better.

I'm not sure if anyone else has had this but there is some slight static noise that happens once in a while when I'm listening to music.  I don't think it's the MP3s because I've never ran into the problem with my other MP3 players.  If only they would've added the video cable for the TV and kept the charger then I would've rated it a 5 \n",
      "Earlier this week I received the factory referbished Samsung HD841.  I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players mainly my Philips 642 which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don't understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note this model has the DVI output If your TV has an HDMI port you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First this model has component composite and Svideo hook ups as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV but to be honest it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing in fact it does not have an index.  But it the main thing is that the player is does perform well and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it not noted in the product discription so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all I will continue to explore this new player but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane the prices are good currently quality has been good and it is a Samsung.Note to the technosavy I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.  Note 2 the factory referbished models come with a DVI cable a 2030 dollar value that many don't come with \n",

We're concerned about battery life as in # of recharges before performance decreases but no indication right now that is an issue. I would have give the product 5 stars if it had been cheaper. This class of device is overpriced in general. Amazon's price was very good but overall still seems over priced. I would definately buy another from Amazon as these are 25% more at other places. \n",
      "This cable does improve the image quality but not by much. I was dissappointed to see very little difference between my standard PS2 stock cable and the moster cable I bought.

      "BREAKING NEWS If you are buying a new video playback capable iPod please look for the new iPod Universal dock which has sVideo output for both photos and video.  It is also ready to accept a control remote so you can control your iPod from your sofa.Is this expensive?  The answer is probably yes.  This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500$600) the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However for a couple of uses high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hires TVs it is a great alternative.This dock basically serves three purposes The traditional synch &amp charge function available since the early days. It helps you get \"Line\" output out of an iPod.  Line output is a cleaner higher quality sound output than the usual headphone output out of the miniplug jack.  It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater. The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.  So if you like to show your pictures to your friends &amp family using a hires TV (Plasma LCD or a Flat Screen) this is a great tool to use.  As an alternative if you do not want to use sVideo and are OK with regular digital video out a cheaper alternative is the \"Apple iPod AV Cable\" at $19 from the Apple Store or similar alternatives.In summary buy this if you hook your iPod to high quality audio equipment or if you regularly do hires slide shows on your TV.  If you don't do it it's just too expensive as a synch/charger since anything you need is in the iPod box \n",

It does not support VCR+ or a TViOstyle program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus. It even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk. Every onscreen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.The commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. My only complaint The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on righthand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.At the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I'd say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The fourhour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flexmode option I haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.It's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media but it won't play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison but this unit can play and record on them. Watching one show while another is recording (or the same show that's recording but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained onscreen pretty well but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.One interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using the signal is sent through the svideo output.It can't burn music CD's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won't lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star \n",
      "I purchased the Monster Cable MP HTS 1000 without reading the reviews(which I don't usually do) for the simple reason of where I purchased my hdtv Samsung HLS5687w they were trying to sell me but for a $150 which was too much.  I plugged in my equipment to the monster and at first there was no picture only sound.  I have directv and they have a connection which allows you to receive digital and analog signals through the same cable.  That connection needs to be placed after the monster in the connection loop.  After switching around the cables I had a picture again.  I can't really see an improvement in the picture quality (HD is beautiful) I bought the monster basically for the protection \n",
      "The 50G is the successor to the HP 49G. They both accept only a maximum of 1GB SecureDigital flash cards since they only have an approximate 1GB operating system file address space. Only about  0.9GB of the SecureDigital flash cards (a little more on the HP 49G than on the HP 50G) are accessible. The manuals only vaguely state that they recognice FAT16 and FAT32 SecureDigital flash cards. The HP 50G has a black case with a black metallic faceplate. The white and orange shift key labels on the metallic black faceplate have much better contrast and are easier to distinguish than the HP 49G red (or tomato) and turquiose shift key labels on the tan anodized faceplate. The black HP 50G looks tastefully geared for serious users. They still have no display backlighting or a color display. The HP 50G keyboard feels a little more compliant than the HP 49G but it would be nicer if they were as buttery smooth as the original early 1970's series of the HP hand held calculators \n",
      "The convenience of this product is terrific.  Whenever I show people how it snaps in half they're amazed at the ingeniousness of it and they say how they want to get one.  Now that all computers have USB ports I can put my photos into any computer anytime I want without worrying about the docking station.  A musthave product for every digital camera \n",
      "Great product. It's two in one. You have it in your camera and take photos next you can plug it into the USB port and download data. It's worth the money \n",
      "First time I heard these I was floored by the output.  Nice high mid and low bass sounds no matter what you have going thru them be it music games or movies.  Definately worth the low low price...First person WWII shooter games like Call of Duty sound awesome with these speaker \n",
      "I am going to strictly comment on the Linksys PAP2. A lot of the reviews on here have been for the Vonage service. The Linksys PAP2 is NOT THE Vonage service but one of many adapters you can use. I am extreamly satisfied with my Linksys PAP2. It is small light weight and perfect for those who need to travel. The voice quality is excellent and people say I do not sound like I am talking over VOIP. There is no line noise static popping etc. I am giving this product 4 stars. Why? Because there is only ONE ethernet port. If you have a router just connect the PAP2 to one of your available ethernet ports and you are good to go. If you do not have a router consider getting another Vonage phone adapter with built in 4port router. There are several. \n",
      "I read the other reviews and don't understand where they are coming from UNLESS they are all by AT&ampT or BELL employees.  I've had Vonage for 3 years and have nothing but good things to say about it.  I have local numbers for Seattle Salt Lake City Boston and San Francisco so my friends can stay in touch. These numbers only cost me $4.99/each a month.  Customer service is excellent.  They stay right on the phone with you until everything works perfectly.  This is especially nice after they added 911 service \n",
      "I'm using Monster optical cable as well but with different reasons behind. Anybody with a basic knowledge of physics or optics should know that under normal condition light is not susceptible to interference from  magnetic field or EMF \n",
      "This is the best lock you can find for laptops but I am still not very confident with it. It looks flimpsy but better than others \n",
      "Installation on a normal home network setup is very easy. My setup was a little more complex due to voip router and 2nd wireless router. Sling has instructions on their web site but I still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work. To work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. Once I worked this out everything is great. Video quality is good in the house haven't tried it from another location. I'm running the Sling AV with Netgear Ethernet power adaptors to my router and then watching TV via wireless to my laptop. Now we can watch TV in any room of the house. My wife loves being able to watch the news in the morning while in the kitchen. She also loves being able to surf while having a show running in a small window on the side. Control of my Dish DVR is very good. We can manage any feature of our Satelite/DVR box. This will come in handy when we travel as we have our sons Seaseme Street shows on the DVR and now we can take those with us on the road. Overall I'm pleased with the Sling AV. It offers good performance at a great price point. Now Sling just needs to get the Mac version out so I can watch TV on my beautiful 15.4 inch Mac Book Pro \n",
      "This is a quality built toner cartridge but for the money it should have a great toner capacity \n",
      "I bought this item about 4 months ago and do not have a single complaint.  I use it in Chicago.  A lot of reviews say it takes a long time to acquire a satellite signal not true at all.  I think the longest I have ever waited was 20 seconds.  It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.Overall this GPS works perfectly.  The autoreroute is fantastic it is very quick to recalculate my route if I miss a turn and the voice prompts give you plenty of warning in advance of a turn. You will not be disappointed with this purchase \n",
      "Soundwise the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s were everything that they were supposed to be.  The bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted.  The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection.  Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case.Something to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound.  The wires themselves are long enough and there shouldn't be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room.  One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8\" plugs for hooking up the sound source.  If you want optical you're going to have to go elsewhere.Please note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality.  If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money.  Same goes for music quality if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding not the speakers.  If you can't spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive.Overall these speakers are a great deal.  While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies.  For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system.  Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast don't bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.  If you are more worried about loudness do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers you won't even notice the difference \n",
      "It has some very useful addition from the previous model.  It has cut the time of doing my homework in half \n",
      "Great for frequent air travel to pass the time. Minor complaints  instructions are sparse (had to get my son to show me how to use iTunes &amp load songs) but still haven't figured out how to arrange songs on the iPod. My problem \n"

      "This backpack has been such a useful companion for me.  There are lots of space inside even for huge text books and compartment is arranged just right to hold variety of stuffCDs DVDs paperback books pens cell phones water bottles etc. etc.  There are numerous creative ways of storing stuff.  Indeed my whole life as a student can be inside at once.As a notebook backpack this would not provide the best protection.  Padding is fine but depending on how much stuff you have a notebook inside could be squeezed a bit more than you desire.  Also the clip to fix the cover flap onto the backpack almost is broken after a year of daily use for me.  I have had Dell 14\" and 15\" laptops with the backpack and fitting was just fine for securely hold it inside.  Wearing comfort is pretty good and things are quite adjustable for your body.I would recommend this backpack if carrying more than a laptop e.g. testbooks is essential for you.P.S. I ended up using a warranty support to fix the buckle.  Targus's customer support is first rateprompt courteous and reliable.  They actually replaced the backpack with a newer version of the same product.  Their service totally make them highly recommended \n",
      "I had to 'fix' this ipod holder with a bicycle hand grip to stop it from shaking my ipod. I have a decent car and the roads are just ok but this thing shakes and shakes. I also put one of those beer coolers around the base of the foam hand grip and its now rock solid. Oh yeah and it holds the ipod just right too. I also put some of those velcro dots on the bottom for a little more security from my cup holder \n",
      "I hadn't seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod).The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It's very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them but the standard one was enough for me.The part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups.The only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops) I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn't affect functionality so it doesn't make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn't hold iPods in their cases. So if you're like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok and this one is too if you're willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.Edit I bought it for $20 but now it's $15. One more good reason to get this one.I'm not too sure but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this so don't buy this for your 5G iPod unless you're already sure or can try it before you buy it \n",

This case has met all her needs it is light weight constructed of durable material well organized. Her notebook fits in this top loading case with ease. She is satisfied with this purchase. We would recommend purchasing this case. \n",
      "I have owned many Sony cameras in the past and am currently using two right now. The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory you run out when you need it most. That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig. Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go. Look when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (36 megapixels) per picture which you should always do to get the best possible prints made your camera will need a ton of storage space.  Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn't expected like a wildfire a plane crash a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens. You can always \"resize\" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space. Trust me take large megapixel pics now and you will be amazed at how many shots came out better that you expected.You never know. I have tons of pictures that people ask how did I ever get such good pictures of such amazing things. I have a helicopter crash police car up a power poll deer in downtown Oakland house fire before the Fire Dept got there tons of wild animals any many more things I saw while I was driving somewhere or walking in a park. If you want great photos you have to be prepared when the moment arrivesMatching a camera with its name brand memory is also a great idea. No problems ever The Sony memory sticks I have from 5 to 6 years ago still work great with no problems. They make it fast and easy to transfer data from your camera to your computer. They are tiny wafer thin and extremely light weight and durable. I have first hand knowledge that products with the SONY name on it are first rate and high quality. If you want quality buy SONY \n",

      "I've used the iTrip by Belkin the TunecastII by Belkin and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.I think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI  that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons which is good but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8 I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car it does what it should and does a decent job of it \n",
      "Works precisely as advertised.  None of the complaints in previous reviews hold for my experience. Specifically battery backup works and sound quality of messages is excellent. Only negative too many words spoken by the machine and they sometimes seem to overlap \n",

The controls layout is good with everything in view and accessible on the top. My last machine had some of its controls on the sides causing me to have to pick it up and turn it around and around looking for a particular control. This machine is better in that respect. 3. Learning to use it is a very easy and intuitive process especially if you have used other machines. The included instructions clearly explain how to use its less obvious features.Things I didn't like Nothing really. But some minor annoyances include1. The electronic accent of the generated voice of the machine was a little hard to understand at first. But I quickly \"learned\" its accent. Your callers will never hear it after you record your own greeting which will be clear and sound like you. Otherwise your callers will hear a default message in the machine's voice.2. I installed the 9 volt battery first and the unit would not turn on when plugged into AC. Removing the battery then plugging in the AC then installing the 9 volt battery allowed it to power up and work normally. The battery installation instructions and general installation instructions did not indicate any particular installation sequence requirements regarding the battery \n",

The modem comes with both a USB and 100T ethernet adapter port so use whatever way works best for you.  I tried them both and they appear to work at the same speed.  I am guessing it all depends on the speeds your cable provide is delivering.Amazon had the best price on the product if you have the time to wait for their free shipping.

I am not all that used to the U3 stuff yet but I am sure I will start to use it to its fullest soon.  Coworkers of mine buy the less expensive USB drives and break them.  The SanDisk Cruzer TI is the absolute best \n",
      "I had a small 512 Sandisk a while back so when I saw a review for the Titanium 2GB Cruzer in a popular computer mag I decided to upgrade from my Lexar 1GB.  So far I'm very impressed.  Just did a 1.26GB transfer that took 140 seconds.  I was a big leery of the included software but was pleased to see that if I didn't care for it it was easily removed.  I have not had an issue with either the software or the drive and am very impressed with the design of the retractable interface that requires pressure to expose or retract.  This is a very good drive and contrary to the negative comments I would encourage anyone looking for a fast stylish practical jump drive to seriously conside the Titanium Cruzer \n",
      "I am satisfied by the purchase of this Targus CVR600 15.4 Groove Notebook Backpack since it is super wide comfortable and with many compartments to keep objects  apart of the laptop. I recommend it to you \n",
      "Great buy for a wonderful speaker system. Works beautifully with my MAC Mini for great sound. Would not hesitate to purchase again. Great contemporary look on my desk. So easy to turn the volume up or down either from my screen or the subtle touch control on the Creature. I highly recommend \n",
      "I recommend these speakers  have had them for 3 months now and they are great  sound quality is great.  Power converter gets pretty hot though so i suggest putting it on something non flammable  don't think it would catch anything on fire but just to be safe.  Speakers are not super loud but are great if you just want quality sound. \n",
      "Recently bought a Analog Big Screen TV. Switched from SVideo to Component cables. There is a big difference. The picture looks more film like with Component cables. Do not hesitate to upgrade. Stay away from cheap Wally World brands. You get what you pay for. The SVideo cable I used was Monster Cable M1000 sv \n",
      "I got one of these a few years ago.  It's been to several countries on camping trips bicycle trips subways etc etc and held together very well.  I pop this and the handspring into my pocket and off I go not lugging around a huge laptop anymore.The typing is comfortable this is just like a laptop keyboard and while I too have worried about the little popup part where you connect the handspring it's taken a beating so far.  I'm buying another preemptively because I'll be so bummed when I do eventually manage to break the current one.The hinge in the middle is annoying  you have to put the thing on a book or other flat surface to hold it in your lap.  I think that when the new one comes I'll try to create some kind of deadbolt mechanism to hold the middle hinge when it's open and then it will be the single most perfect gadget ever \n",
      "Let me just preface this review by mentioning that I read many customer reviews(here and elsewhere) on this product before purchasing it. I focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws. After using this keyboard for almost 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality. Command Pad Many reviews bash this feature. It is quite a basic pad as compared to some but it gets the job done. My only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrlaltdelete. During games such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever. The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me. The customers who claimed it to be \"impossible\" and \"buggy\" seem to be computer illiterate at best and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews possible English illiterate as well. If you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad.Keyboard The quietness response and overall feel of the keys rival any Logitech design. I am a huge fan/customer of Logitech equipment and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality. Saitek took a more simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc...) and the price shows it.*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of keysymbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. Last and probably least comes the aesthetics of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch especially for the keyboard deficient I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I've been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination apparently an oversight on their part. I will recap this lengthy review by recommending this keyboard to any capable computer enthusiast who desires a good value.   \n",
      "Upgraded from 19\" Viewsonic CRT. This monitor is superb Recommendation go with native resolution enable Clear Type through display settings and download the monitor drivers from Viewsonic (XP uses standard drivers not as good as Viewsonic's imo) then restart makes a huge difference over settings out of the box. \n",
      "I love my Shure E3C earphones and up until recently was pretty happy with the foam sleeves. However I was constantly having to reset them in my ears when engaged in strenuous activities. The first time I tried these triple flange sleeves I thought I had wasted my money. Later I pulled my ear up and they slid in a lot further... and suddenly I was in heaven. I get the full sound that I love so much complete with throbbing bass line AND the things stay in my ears until I pop them out These are the perfect complement to a wonderful headset  \n",
      "It says the keyboard is supposed to be easier and more comfortable to type with. I don't think it is that comfortable. It's a little hard getting used to so be prepared to hit the backspace a couple of times. The keyboard is 100mA and uses USB connection. There is a USB to PS/2 converter included. Overall it is an ok product for the money as it is the cheapest USB keyboard I've found \n",
      "Arrived in time decent quality for the price. Is a bit difficult to close though as the zip isn't awesome. But as I said it's good for the price \n",

      "This is a very good skin for 60 GB &amp 80 GB owners.  It completely covers the entire iPod without sacrificing functionality.  What separates this skin from other skins it the Visor (a plastic shield which protects the screen).  My only problem with this skin is the belt clip.  It is impossible to remove and difficult to use.  A better belt clip would make this the perfect skin.  This is a very good price from TechGNet.  \n",
      "I have this card for a week and what I can tell you is that this card has a quality that I've never heard from any sound card  the sound is so clean balanced and accurrate.of coure you will need a good set of spekaers.the CMSS surround is much better than Dolby Prologic 2 and DTS neo 6 for both music and movies.if you plan to connect the DIN cable for Integrated speakers control with the Megaworks or Gigaworks you should know that it's not working but Creative is going to add support for those speakers in the following drivers.I didn't like the new 24bit Crystalizer sound but belive me you will not need that feature just use good mp3 player like Winamp 5+ MAD mp3 decoder plug and ASIO plug for the output.I had many sound card like the Audigy 2  Audigy 2 ZS Audigy 4 Pro ESI Juli@ Maudio Revolution...and none of theme even close to this cardworth every $$$I recommend you buying from amazon beacuse of thier great service and warrnty I could't do that because I am outside USA \n",

      "I have long struggled to find the perfect remote.  The URC9910 isn't it but its pretty good.  Its no match for my Harmony 880 but it also costs a whole bunch less and works through walls.  I have 2 URC9910s both programmed identically for my main HT.  The cabinet also contains a second reciever and a sound distribution center for the other rooms in the house.  The kids can be using one URC9910 with the TV/HT and I can be in the basement or outside and control the volume of my music with the RF part of the second URC9910 remote.  For the price you can't beat it.  All buttons AFIK are progammable or mappable.  Setting it us is a pain and I had to find some pretty obscure codes on the internet to get my TV to do its thing so that is where it looses a star.  Otherwise its a great performer and with the price I don't mind if my kids use it whereas they aren't allowed to use my Harmony 880.If cost is no object then there are better remotes.  For the price I can't find one better \n",

      "I bought this to replace an Epsom printer that refused to print accurate color and an old Canon scanner. I am very very pleased It looks terrific (my daughter said \"Wow cool new printer\"). Set up was easy. And the printing is fast and absolutely beautiful even in draft mode. Better yet the cartridges are much cheaper than my Epson ones. Scanning is easy and good too. I don't use fax so can't rate that function.Overall I am thrilled with this printer. It was well worth the $180 \n",
      "I received the correct Q5949X cartridge.My calculations for cost per page is only 2 cents per page which is contrary to another reviewer's claim of 12 cents per page.$120.00 divided by 6000 pages equals 2 cents per page. \n",

      "I have a Gateway CX2610 and it always got hot in my lap after about 10 or 15 minutes.  Enter this Targus lapdesk.  When folded out it provides a nice buffer between my lap and the heat of the laptop even when using the laptop for upwards of two hours.But wait there's more  I had also found my laptop awkward to use at a desk because of the poor ergonomics.  However I use this lapdesk folded with the adjustable leg to reposition the keyboard to a better angle for typing.  It also puts the screen at a better height as well.The desk also works well folded in half with my laptop converted to tablet mode.  So it's a very versatile accessory to go with my versatile laptop.  I highly recommend it \n",
      "I got the newer model of these with the blue light on the speakers . All I can say is that these speakers are worth the money. You get what you pay for. These speakers have pretty good highs in them bass wise there decent. They hit alright and sub decent. You pay more money you get a better system you know. This system here isn't much money so it isn't going to be the best. So there isn't no reason for the bad reviews. I think they work really good for the price their tagged at. So if your looking for a system with some good highs and decent bass these are for you \n",

Mind you I had paid like $200 for Sear's sorry 35 year? warranty and it turned out they wouldn't have replaced it or probably fixed it even though my sister worked there.  I heard a sickening crash (like the picture tube/glass breaking).  It still works and only has a dent it the top left.  I think I got the remote a little wet years ago and it never worked again.  Not a big deal since I have a directv remotebut I forgot I even had PIP because of no remote.  From now on if I can afford it I will buy sony only.  I bought an xplode cd player 2 years ago with no problems except a dead remote that I never use \n",
      "This TV weighs a ton took three adult males to pick it up off of the floor and load it into an entertainment armoire. I have owned several Sony TVs and really thought hard about this purchase because of firmware issues that I have had with a 27\" Sony. Mainly compared this model with the corresponding Panasonic Tau absolutely hated the Tau remote and am very familiar with the Sony. Note that the remote was not the deciding criteria but it was a consideration. I have no real complaints about this TV the menu system is nice and the picture very good. I do not normally use the builtin speakers so really can't comment about their sound. This TV has a 169 enhanced mode that must be selected from the menus I tried it once using a DVD as source input and liked the widescreen format that the DVD player provides better than the 169 mode. The 27\" Sony that I have has an autovolume feature this 36\" does not and I do miss it. I would purchase this unit again. Note that there is a very similar Sony model that has upgraded sound but not consider it because the added width would not fit in the armoire \n",

What a monitor stand does is it raises the monitor to make it easier on your neck to view.  I have an IBM laptop and I place it on top of the stand.  With the stand I probably have to look down at most about 1015 degrees.  Before the stand I would have to look down at about 35 degrees.  This does not seem like much but if you spend alot of time staring at a computer screen your neck will be sore.  Buy this stand and your neck will thank you.  \n",
      "The case itself fits very snug around the IPOD and even gives it a better look.  The only complaint that I have is that the plastic window that covers the dial pops open and even falls off at times.  I still give the case a 4 star rating because I am a soldier in Iraq and this case is doing a very good job of keeping my IPOD clean.  If a product can keep something clean in Iraq then I am guessing that it can keep things clean anywhere.  \n",
      "What can I say it's a rubber case that stretches over my Ipod. There's little room for malfunction.

      "I agree with most of the reviews here.  The PC155 is a great headset overall.  The sound quality is great.  Volume is more than adequate and fidelity is excellent.  I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use both on the cord and on the PC.Audio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually I wear highquality buds.  So perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.So despite my positive review of the sound quality I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.UPDATE I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s I would get the 165s instead \n",
      "I purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone.  The combination is killer.  I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only but for me the quality is far better than what I have with my phone and it was really as easy as plug and play.  I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller which is important to me especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO this is too complementary.  For its price and features a good buy and good sound quality but IMO this is not an audiophile headphone.  \n",
      "All 3 kids have a Tunebase.  It works great easy to use.  It also charges the iPod while we travel \n",
      "I've gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They've included Koss \"The Plug\" Sennheiser PX100 Koss UR29 Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far this has been the closest I've had to a good balance.For my tastes (not necessarily anybody else's) strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area despite what everybody else seemed to say  weaker than my old Sony MDRNC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They're also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation but were a little uncomfortable warm heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD420s.The K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear even at moderately low volumes with no distortion at all. Isolation isn't as good as the UR29 but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller but they're a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 5560% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds I now run at 3540% comfortably. In terms of comfort they're comfortable enough for hours of wearing after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears first extend the headband all the way then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don't bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error but in the end you get goodsounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You'd be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You'll know if you've unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here's an easy test with a finger on each side press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn't get stronger as you press (the way it does with all openair headphones) that's as good a seal as you need. I hated the little square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don't use these pads so I don't think they're really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads especially after more than half an hour. In fact without the pads I barely feel the headband at all.Overall I'm satisified especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way don't be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada. Read the whole warranty sheet A separate section on the sheet covers a limited warranty for these countries so yes it is covered \n",

      "I initially purchased this model then returned it in favor of the Sony SRFM37V because of its five onebutton presets which make it a nobrainer to use while exercising.  However the SRF59 perhaps because of its analog tuning suffers less from cochannel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It's audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind I purchased another SRF59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bassheavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with blessfully very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds it became apparent that with bassheavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF59's tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless the sound quality from this bargainpriced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine after all how could it be it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).  For more on this model and others visit Xin Feng's website.  I highly recommend this model for cheap thrills          \n",

We have used it on several aiplane trips and my toddler is very entertained.  We haven't had any problems with the mechanics of the player.  We also bought a case (which I highly recommend) so that we have enough Baby Einstein to keep her happy to our destination.  Also the battery has never run out and charges quickly.  My only problem with it is that the volume doesn't go up loud enough without earphones to hear it very well in a roaring commercial airliner.  But my daughter mostly looks at the pictures anyway so it wasn't that big a deal for us.  \n",

The player is sleek and so is the battery but together are a bit bulky not bad. Screen quality is good great for a portable. Made of good quality materials. I've had it for a month and nothing is showing signs of wearntear.A recommended accessory to purchase is a carrying case which will haul all your addons that are included.

The case that keeps the dvd player on the back of the seat needs a little work but we figured out a way to make it work for us.

      "These speakers are not what i had expected from their size price and looks.  Their quality even at high volumes exceeds many other speakers i've seen at double the price tag.  The reason I bought these was because of the other reviews and the size.  Another reason was the proposed battery life 35 hours on 4 aaa batteries not bad at all.  So far its been very close.  I have heard the other speaker (systems) and yes the JBL OnStage and the Bose Sounddock are both very good and do live up to their reputations but your stuck with using them only when there is an outlet nearby \n",

It toasts it bakes it looks nice and it has the knobs that my hubby likes in lieu of digital. Overall it's a great oven and we have no complaints with it's cooking abilities or the sturdiness of the unit but less than a month later one of the knobs broke off the unit. They are completely plastic and no metal reinforcement to prevent this from happening. My hubby sent an email to Cuisinart and they are sending a replacement knob but one would have expected better engineering from a name like Cuisinart \n",
      "When we needed speaker systems for a batch of new workstations price was the main consideration. The price for these units was well below budget.  Since our main application for them was for audioenhanced CAT (Computer Assisted Training) High fidelity and volume were not issues.  They worked admirably for the purpose.The use of a USB port for the power supply was a clever twist. One of my aggravating support woes is keeping speaker power adapters matched up with corresponding speakers.  I had been buying unpowered (unamplified) units with no manual volume control.  The USB trick gives me just what I want \n",
      "I've purchased several Logitech mice(cordless optical)and I've been satisfied with all of them except for the battery life.  I had to change the batteries in my previous mouse once a month.  This new Logitech mouse is terrific.  It's been several months and I have not had to change the batteries yet ... and I am not even using the onoff switch (I want to test the battery life without the switch first).  Battery issues aside the mouse is smooth light and accurate.  It was simple to install and I'd buy it again in a heartbeat \n",

      "I bought this headset and I must say it's a great buy. First off it's lightweight weighing in at about 16 grams. It's small which definately helps when your wearing it around. At times it's like you don't even feel liek your wearing anything. Exactly how a headset should be. I've place and recieved many calls with it already and having been using the the traditional wired headsets of the past this headset sound better and has no wires. The only problem I have found so far is that it takes some time getting used to the button placement and answering calls with the headset. Not to mention you only hear the standard ringtone rather than your custom ringtones. But that a small price to pay for such a great inexpensive headset like this one \n",
      "I was looking for comfy earphones to replace my Phillips one I got awhile back cos the rubber coating had fallen off and I stumbled on this one. I was a bit skeptical about the volume control thinking it would give out after a few times of sliding up and down but it works wonderfully and is so light and responsive to touch as well as being sturdy. I started out using the foam that came with it but that proved to be a bother and pretty much useless as the plastic earbuds are comfy enough. And they stay in your ears like glue. No more readjusting and I loved that.For the price this SO worth it. \n",
      "I bought These earbuds for the first time 3 years ago for $15 now u can get them for under $10 They last more than six months of hard wear and tear  before they need replacing awsome i've been using them for a long time and don't plan on changin \n",

      "I really likethe design on this Protector and bought 3.It allows you to plug multiple transformers in and still have room for regular plugs. Slipping plus in is a firm push but not that tough. I also like the fact that it gives you a warning light if you get up around 12 amps.. Cool but you have to keep in mind a 15 amp circuit shoulldn't have 12 amps to one plug..The cord restraint system slides out to hold all the cords then wedges backin to hold them in place. A bit hard to set up and a zip tie could achieve the same thing altough this is way easier if you change things \n",
      "Overall I like this surge protector and would buy it again. I bought it primarily because of the 11 outlets six of which are spaced out to accommodate big brickstyle transformer plugs. I did a lot of digging to find the surge protector that had the most outlets in this configuration and this unit always came up.  It has worked just fine for the month or so I've owned it. I particularly appreciate the angled plug which allows you to use the second plug in a wall outlet without a problem.I only have two quibbles with the APCthe color and the stiffness caused by the plugactivated safety shutters.  Plugging and unplugging cords requires some force to overcome the safety shutters which could be a problem if you are trying to get something plugged or unplugged while the unit is in an awkward position or hardtoreach location.  On a much more minor note the black unit and cord stand out quite a bit against lightcolored walls and carpets even when tucked behind a desk.I don't use the phone or coax plugs so I don't know if my unit has the problem (or \"feature\") other reviewers have reported with Internet signal degradation \n",
      "My mp830 has performed well in the time that I've had it.  My family members have found it easy to use as well.  I was saddened at the early demise of my Epson cx6400 which suffered from a common problem of dried ink clogging the feeder tube.  I chose the Canon after reading good reviews and I got it for an excellent price right here on Amazon plus free shipping.  It still sells for more at my local Office Depot and Best Buy. In truth I haven't tried all of it's claimed capabilities but I'm happy with what it's been able to do thus far.      \n",
      "  I use this in my videography business primarily for weddings.  So far I've never had a problem and the mic has always given me a clear recording of voices from a lapel position.  I use it in conjunction with my iRiver795 to record the sound directly and it's worked like a dream... recommende \n",
      "These 2.0 speakers sound great (and not just for their size) are adjustable small and good looking. I'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when I turned the volume up so I could understand human speech. I'm happy I spent the money. These are real quality in my opinion \n",
      "I recently bought an altec lancing headset for $20 and it was the worst headset investment I've made. Horrible support for the ears and very uncomfortable to wear and they eventually broke within a week or two. So I bought this headset and I have been quite pleased with it. The mic output is extremely crisp. While talking with clients they said that it sounds like I'm talking on the telephone with them or better. They are very comfortable and rest on the top of your head unlike many headsets like my prior pair which have a support on the back of the neck which does nothing. All in all a good headset. \n",
      "Works good for me. Some time one can hear some interference but over all a pretty good product \n",
      "This product is awsome i intalled it on my car with a sony stereo system i placed the end of the ilink cable inside of a compartment of my car so i could put my ipod in the sound quality that the cable delivers its outstanding besides it does not look like a cheap cable it has a thick rubber coating that gives it some stiffness....If you are realy thinking on connecting your ipod to your home or car stereo this is the right solution \n",
      "I've been using this CF card on my Nikon 4300 for a couple of months now.  It writes fast compared to my other CF (Canon stock from another camera).

I've also used this on a Dell Axim and it worked great  No problem in formatting \n",
      "I'm still discovering the power of this program  at least when teamed with the Garmin 60CS.

      "There are lots of reviews here and most appear to be ontarget relative to my experience with these headphones.  But here are my 2 centsI got these to replace some aging Sony MDRV2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDRV2's had begun to deteriorate and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO  it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade at the expense of flatness and noncoloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod  and I listen at good levels  albeit not ear damaging ones).As a last comment I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon   (no  I don't work for or invest in them  \n",
      "I bought these after reading over a hundred reviews for them and I agree with the consensus that they deliver a flat uncolored sound with tight but not boomy or overpowering bass. By the way I've owned the Sony MDRV600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion. These have been used by Musicians studio engineers and on air talent for 20 years now \n",

      "I'm not entirely sure how other people are finding ways to damage their earphones but I have used the same pair since the summer of 2000 (purchased from Amazon) and I have never had any difficulties besides losing the essential earpiece covers which were easily replaced. When they are wound up in their little yellow case the headphones' wires are well protected from stress unlike other models that don't offer such security.Compared to other headphones I have used especially noise cancelling of both active and passive varieties these phones have superior bass response and all levels of sound seem reasonably clear.I have used these earphones with many different devices over five years CD players MP3 players (including iPods) Pocket PCs desktops and notebooks. They always sound great EXCEPT  due to their greater sensitivity to sound I often am able to detect the hiss caused by poorly designed audio hardware which I otherwise wouldn't hear with overear phones. Pocket PCs especially seem prone to this as their audio hardware is crammed so tightly in with noisy backlit screens and processors \n",

Radio reception is good I especially like the changing channels feature.  The fact that it charges the iPod while in use even makes it better.  The only negative thing that I've discovered is that sometimes it disconnects from the iPod slot and I have to push it back.  That's mostly due to rattles and I imagine will get worse with time.  Overall good product good value for the money and if carefully handled will last a long time.  \n",

I can always go into the webinterface to view or clear it with no problem.  Another thing to note regarding the log is that VPN (not passthru) has its own separate log area which does not get emailed out.As expected Netgear support is mediocre.  Level 1 support can only handle very simple issues and Level 2 support is VERY slow.  I recommend you use the incidentsubmission area of the \"My Netgear\" website so you can more easily track/respond to support incidents.For those of you using the FR114p model this is basically the same thing with 8connection VPN service minus the printer port.I figure after a few more firmware revisions this will be a really good unit \n",

      "I have had and used two pairs of these headphones over the last year. I have been very happy with them and even bought the second pair to keep as a backup. The Good They are not only noisecancelling but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source in only dulls background noise but I think that's the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noisecancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace put the buds in your ears and use the power and volume controls on the noisecancelling piece.The Bad Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them but they're not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you're sweating or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However that doesn't make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping it generally won't stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned which detracts from the noisecancelling effect. Other Thoughts The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However if the player is in a pants pocket it could be a little close. Also I often wear it when I'm not using it because you can forget it's there and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring  I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However I blame myself for that  it was a mighty tug.I bought mine at Target where they were labelled $24.99 on \"clearance\" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another \"clearance\" price) I bought a second pair as a backup. I'm glad I did  I'm still using the second pair. Battery life is great. I don't know how many hours I get but I can go at least a couple of weeks using my iPod for at least a couple of hours per day listening to podcasts and audiobooks \n",

      "Amazon has a nice price on the JBL Duet Speakers (July 2006  36.95) dealmac is a site I used and returned to amazon.I purchased these for my office desk where I wanted a crisp sound for low volume daily listening. Anything from Ambient to Rock and Jazz. They produce sounds nicely nice tight crisp. If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers as the 2pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the \"hints\" of bass in the music but no thud if that's what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. Build quality is \"ok\". I got the white speakers and they are the nice \"Mac\" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  The design is very modern and cool tho. They look nice on my desk.You will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully... break in. They sound awful right out of the box and after maybe one hour of keeping these on they will sound better.On the low end of speakers out right now these will probably sound the best and are most modern design compared to the black boxes out there \n",

But now that the laptop screen is up at eye level I tend to use it just as often as the big monitor  It turns out that my dislike of the laptop screen had more to do with having to look down at it even though I was not aware of that until I got it raised.  \n"

      "As you may already know this is an accessory handset which will only work if you have one of these Panasonic models KXTG2700/KXTG2720 KXTG2730/KXTG2740. The Panasonic KXTGA271V does not need (or use) a telephone jack. It simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above.This phone was also very easy to register. (It had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) I simply had to press the \"MUTE\" button on my base unit and then press the \"PLAY\" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the LCD display on the phone) Please know that I did find the Panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.Some features that are NOT mentioned in this description which ARE included are finger grips/ergonomic sizing on the sides of the phone the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone (the base unit to the KXTG2730 has a digital answering machine and I suspect the other Panasonic models do as well)  THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE YES THE KXTGA271V WILL PLAY YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGES OFF THIS PHONE THROUGH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OF IT a separate \"call waiting\" dedicated button is also included.Also this phone will use any standard headset it does NOT need a Panasonic branded headset. This was very important for me because I ofen use a headset and I do not want to purchase another one. I have since learned that ALL cordless phone headsets can be used on ANY type of cordless phone Please know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the KXTG2730 system (that is the model that I have.) Also the KXTG2730 phone can't be charged in this charger and vice versa. That is (likely) because the KXTGA271V phone is slightly smaller and weighs less. The face of the phone is white with a purple trim. The back of the phone is also purple on the bottom and white on the top half. The \"white\" in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white and the \"purple\" is not shiny at all. Some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the KXTG2730 model. And the LCD screen is not flat it is indented slightly and bordered in silver. I purchased this phone from an Amazon.com merchant and am very pleased with it. I noticed that another Amazon.com merchant is selling the same phone that I purchased for less ($30.) however that merchant has HORRIFIC feedback and I was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that I would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work Panasonic makes very good phones. The only (big) problem is the battery life. The batteries often die after less than 90 minutes. I have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries. However this is still not a perfect solution. So I had to purchase another set of cordless phones (Uniden.) I now keep two phones in each of the rooms that I had each of the Panasonic phones and so far have not run in to any problems. I hope Panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon.All in all this is an excellent phone. I hope the extra details that I provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision. Amazon.com rarely provides specific details to these types of questions (does Amazon.com only employ braindead dimwits?) and the Panasonic Website does not offer this info \n",
      "I recently bought an HP 17\" widescreen laptop and needed to find a case for traveling. This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder. It has a pocket that it slides into if not needed that came in handy in the airport.This case looks extremely sturdy (well built)and dirt just seems to wipe right off of it. It holds my 17\" laptop PDA Cell phone computer mouse onetimeuse cameras Ipod and all the wires and chargers for those electronics. I even fit two books keys a folder filled with directions and plane tickets a notebook and two dvd's in here. (all of that at the same time) Granted all that stuff makes it pretty heavy to lug around the airport so if you are doing that routinely you are going to want something with wheels or backpack form. The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted but it is not detachable (which means it isn't likely to fall off easily).This bag is extremely welldesigned. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.Because this bag does all that and more it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However I am 5'1\" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York. It looks great if I needed to go to a meeting with my laptop I would gladly take it in this case. It looks professional enough.happy buyingps. let me add that finding a decently priced case for a 17\" laptop that has all the features this one does is nearly impossible. Also in the stores I checked this was sold for about 30 dollars more than here on amazon If you have a smaller laptop this case will work just fine too It has an adjustable divider. You will just gain more room for other stuff. I look foward to long usage of this case. \n",

However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.The big gripes I've seen repeated in the other reviews are1) Poor radio reception.2) No Bass from the mini speakers.3) Short Battery life.1) I never use this to listen to the radio so I won't comment on it good or bad. But there are thousands of good and cheep radio's on the market so if you need a radio go buy a radio.2) I'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone's yield small bass. It's a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room it's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.3) Battery Life. I'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 3035 hours of use when I'm on the road using the AA's. When at home or in a hotel the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. Perhaps this is because I primarily play MP3 disks which it spins up to read into it's buffer then spins down until it needs more data. Anyway I wanted to toss in my two cents as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners and I would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a Walkman sized device.. It's my hope that we'll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit. But bottom line I've got my monies worth and if anyone doesn't want theirs I'd be glad to take it off their hands. \n",

      "I researched cases upon receipt of my 20 GB iPod and deemed this the best.  This case consists of a thin plastic sleeve inside a separate clear hard shell.  The hard case protects the iPod from scratches and minor falls while still allowing easy access to the controls and inputs.  It also does not obscure the screen.  An enclosed plastic belt clip attaches to the back of the unit.  This case is not compatible with a Bose Sounddock as the user must remove the iPod from the case.  Also Contour Design only enclosed one of the thin plastic sleeves.  I spent $5 at their website for 5 more sleeves and gave some to friends with the same case.  The price seems high for a couple pieces of plastic but a case is essential and this is the best one for the 20 GB iPod.  \n",

      "I've had this controller for over a year now and it still works great and reliably as ever.  After many months the analog sticks occasionally drifted a little but a quick jiggle and they'd be back to center.  The profiler software is excellent allowing you to fully map the controller to your keyboard and even mouse.  This allows you to play any game with the controller even ones which don't naturally support gamepads like Splinter Cell.  With the \"shift\" profile function you can effectively double the number of buttons which I found great for playing a complicated flight sim like XWing Alliance completely keyboard free using only the gamepad.Only downside The Dpad is hard to control precisely.  It's difficult to press only Up Down Left or Right.  You almost always end up pressing a diagonal direction instead.  This made the Dpad more or less unusable for games like Street Fighter but then the analog stick was a perfect alternative anyway \n",
      "First I should say that I'm surprised at how sharp and clear the image is.  The display card at CompUSA said this monitor has a 10001 contrast ratio and I'm not sure what that means but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture.  The contrast ratio is higher than most other flatpanels I looked at which have a contrast ratio of around 5001 to 7001 (including Samsung's own 20.1\" nonwidescreen model).  Everything is crystalclear which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies.  It is also good for gaming  Halflife 2 and Unreal Tournament 2004 for example both look great.Its widescreen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks.  It also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 43 (which makes a square picture centered on the screen) so if you have any games or other applications that don't support widescreen modes you can use 43 mode so that the picture doesn't look stretched and distorted.  Plus the monitor has DVI analog VGA SVideo and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees and it has builtin speakers and a headphone jack.Being a flatpanel display it is also lightweight and compact which is ideal for areas where space is limited.  This is my first flatpanel display and I was surprised at how lightweight it really is.All of these features especially the sharp image make this a great monitor and it is worth the money \n",

      "The den of horrors that is the Magellan car bracket requires you to have this power cord. If you don't then you will be fighting to change batteries and remount your GPS and that is no fun at all.I have used mine for over six months and it works without a hitch. A nice improvement would be a retractable cord facility so that you don't have excess cordage lying around your dashboard. Right now I loop the excess around the steering wheel but then again I never change the adjustment on the steering wheel so no problem with the wire getting caught up in the adjusting mechanism. Others may run into this problem. The alternative is a shorter wire but then it would make the power unit useless for some vehicles. A minor hitch but not earthshaking. \n"

      "After reading the online reviews of this product vs. the portable product I went with this one. Portability is not much of a need I plan on being around a power outlet. The sound is in line with a radio/boom box of the same size and it's about the same weight. I have a lot of trees around my house so I have to extend the antenna several feet out the back door in order to get a good signal. Keep that in mind if you have signal issues with your satellite unit. I have my unit placed next to the back door in the kitchen and I can hear it all over the first floor of my home. So far I'm happy that I bought it \n",

      "This case is a veritable dirt magnet.  It attracts more lint than I ever knew existed on my desk.  However it protects very well.  One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the hard plastic front of the case scratching my screen.  However it doesn't even touch the ipod.  Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn't quite as sensitive it makes it more precise in my opinion seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It's still vibrant.  One complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button.  Truthfully this doesn't bother me because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button.  But those without could have a great deal of difficulty.  Also the hole for the headset isn't quite large enough and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod so I do not know how those would fare).  Overall it's a great case that you won't lose your grip on.  It protects well and you never have to take it off even to plug it in.  I would recommend it though it is a bit pricy.    In a bit of an update with this case on my iPod survived a ferret attack with only one little tiny puncture mark on the outside of the case.  I think this case is well worth the money.  My iPod could have been destroyed but it's perfect \n",
      "Printers have gotten inexpensive.  Let's face it the game is cheap printers and then the consumer buys cartridge after cartridge of ink refills.

A great inkject that doesn't consumer *that* much ink.  It copies and scans.  I have used every function am pleased with them all.Sure it feels a little flimsy it is a small machine meant to do work that you are used to seeing a huge piece of hardware accommodate in a standard office.  However it has held up well to some serious use in the past couple months so that flimsiness isn't really even a complaint.  And I work from an office in my home three weeks out of each month so I am more than glad I can reproduce all the functionality my \"real\" office provides me.All in all worth the money \n",
      "We bought this phone and two additional handsets eleven months ago.  One handset gave us problems from the start but was promptly replaced when returned for service.  The system works fine in our 2story 2300 sq. ft. home.  I did notice some reception problems carrying the handset into the closed garage with the base station upstairs on the opposite end of the house.  As a test I took the handset down the street about 100 yards away  it still got a clear dialtone to the base located in upstairs bedroom facing the street.  I like the features including paging system call transfer and handset speakerphone.  Being able to have a phone at any 110v outlet location is a big plus.  I think the sound quality is very good and the controls well laid out and pretty intuitive.  I agree that having to enter memory numbers into each handset is a drag.Overall I feel it works as advertised and we'll be using it for a long time \n",
      "I bought this phone over 6 months ago and absolutely love it  It has great sound quality.  I love the features it has such as speakerphone caller ID and it's phone directory.

Four of the games appear to act as \"trial\" versions although it's impossible to enter the registration codes.

      "This is a great multifunction printer/scanner/copier/fax machine for a small office or home business that has a light to moderately light document workload.Print quality is excellent scanning quality is excellent copying quality is excellent faxing is faxing.The control software is fine not great but it does the job.  The networking features including builtin wireless makes this printer a snap to integrate into your office / business using a wireless network.  Some concerns  after heavy usage the top document feeder used for scanning faxing or photocopying a stack of loose documents begins to jam.  The rollers need to be cleaned to avoid this and getting jammed paper out of the top document feeder is very difficult.   However the fact that this piece of equipment even has a document feeder for this sort of functionality is pretty good.  The fax log keeps a record of outgoing faxes and you can resend them easily enough but you can't reprint faxes received the fax log merely logs their reception but not the fax itself.Overall it's a good multifunction at a reasonable price with a lot of functionality built into it.  Would recommend to anyone who only has a light document load with maybe the occasional large document scanning / copying requirement \n",
      "As long as I own a pair of these headphones I will never use bass boost or a graphic equalizer again.  They sound PERFECT.  I cannot fathom a more balanced natural sound.  These babies put you in the recording studio or in the concert hall  Bass is crisp taut and strong. You can feel it. Yet it is not overbearing or boomy. Midrange is balanced so well that you'd swear you were standing next to the lead guitarist and the treble is so crisp and clear that you will rediscover the percussion sections of your favorite tunes. The folding feature is handy.The only things to be aware of are the following  First you have to break them in.  They start sounding better after a few hours of use.  Second they don't have an inline volume control which I will dearly miss from my Koss KTXpro1s.  Finally plenty of sound escapes.  So don't crank them too much in the library or at Grandma Edith's funeral.  Other than that you have no excuse.  Put your iPod's lousy white earbuds in the garbage disposal where they belong and order these (or if you don't want to fork out $40 order the Koss KTX Pro titanium phones  which are almost as good as these and definitely the best in the sub$20 price range.)  \n",
      "Good sound for the price and very durable. Discrete design. I prefer the \"plug\" design to other headphones. They don't fall out and I can listen to music at low volume at home or in a plane it makes almost no difference. Just be careful in the traffic )The  sound is good especially for music where the bass is most important but the treble is also good for pop and rock. The middle range is a bit dry for e.g. classical music but still good enough for an mp3player. I have two pairs. \n",
      "These earphones are excellent quality. Noise that gets in from outside is so low that I can barely hear what someone next to me is telling me. In addition the frequency response and quality of the sound is comparable to the much larger and bulkier insulated headphones. These earphones do in fact rest in your ear. It can be slightly uncomfortable to put them in the first time but you quickly get used to it especially when sound is playing. In addition the package includes three sets of differently sized earpieces including the default midsized piece shown. \n",
      "I just got my NANO last week and the minute I turned it on (before even transfering any music to it) I could hear a faint noise/buzz from the nano.  It comes on when the power is on and goes off as soon as I turn off the unit.  Has anyone experienced this with theirs?  My first generation nano does not experience this noise.  I plan to take it to an Apple store and try to get a replacement.Just a bit frustrating when you plopped down the $250 and the new toy already appears to be defective.  Lesson learned for everyone else if you don't have to get a new toy right when it comes out...wait...let them get the bugs sorted out first on new adopters like myself \n",
      "I have never been a fan of the Ipod. I have been an Iriver H120 H320 and H340 owner. I had a Toshiba Gigabeat and currently own an Archos AV500. The reason for owning a Nano is because of the size of the AV500. It is too big to pack around unless I am on the bike or have a backpack or coat on. The Nano solves this problem and other than not having a remote (soon) I am very happy with it. It loads from Itunes very easily and I have had no problems with it not playing certain files (and I would reencode them if there was a problem.) Apple don't let me down \n",
      "The KOSS Pro4AA's were not made for iPod/MP3 headphone users.  TO begin with they reveal the low fidelity of MP3 files (compared with LP's or CD's).  Also they require a 1/4\"to3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.These Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974 and notice that the Senators &amp attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.NEGATIVES1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studioreference headphones)2) Tight headband  as noted the fit is fatiguing if your 'hat size' is greater than 7 1/2.3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it's actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).POSITIVES1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro4AA's is almost impossible to beat.2) VALUE. As noted above for the price you pay these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone fusing a coil.4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.The sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.The biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro4AA's for audio mixing other studio applications and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters they are heavy and bulky so they're not easily concealed and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs these require additional hardware.  If you just want 'jogging/exercise music' then these will not work well. If you want hifidelity at a bargain price the Pro4AA's are still the best choice around. \n",

      "My first purchase of the Q9b resulted in a return as the display wasn't mounted properly within the plastic housing. This resulted in the screen being tilted downwards about 1/4\" and made the viewing unpleasant. The screen also wasn't very bright even with the brightness controlled up at 100%. Having to disassemble the unit to place it back in the box required the base stand to be taken apart but that was next to impossible without breaking it. Suffice to say quality control missed this one.After getting a new Q9b replacement I unfortunately had a bad pixel. After using the Q9b for a week now I noticed some red aliasing between characters. The crispness of the display is fine but I changed display fonts to 120dpi to make it look better. The control buttons on the monitor are too small. The builtin speakers leave less than desired and useless. The Q9b does not have DVI ports. At 1280x1024 mode its fine for doing basic computing like web surfing and office applications. Viewing DVD movies at full 1280x1024 mode was difficult to watch.  At smaller sizes (400x300) was fine.All in all the Q9b is not a bad monitor for the price for general computing work \n",

      "After ordering nonOEM inks from several different places on the web (and having some problems with them) I discovered that Amazon sold OEM at great prices.I went to my local office supply store and purchased a complete set of 5 inks for my Canon Pixma iP4000 at a cost of $75.  Later that day I found them on Amazon at almost 1/2 the priceAlso when it comes to OEM inks I discovered that they seem to last almost 3 times as long as the generic and refilled versions. \n",

      "Product was as described...reception was strong and weak depending on your location...was able to receive all frequencies..rated this a 4 instead of a 5 only because when the wind blew the reception would get fuzzy...could get annoying on a very windy day..radio is bulky and heavy.. \n",
      "I have used GPS units from Cobra Garmin and Lowrance.  I consider this Cobra unit to be one of the best.  I started with the Cobra but it was stolen after a month.  Then I bought the Lowrance but it was too heavy and the mount was a sgood as the Cobra. I returned the Lowrance and bought the Garmin 340.Advantages of the Cobra is that it has a large screen and a solid mount (despite its size).  The interface isn't quite as intuitive as Garmin but once you learn it it is actually better.  The traffic service is also nice (costs more with the Garmin).  The Cobra is the most capable of the GPS units I mentioned but overall I am happier with the Garmin because of it's smaller size and lower price \n",
      "The unit operates as good as any other GPS system available plus it has a great big screen of 5 inches.  I am very impressed with the GPS but the mount used to attach the unit to the window or dash is very poorly designed.  The unit falls off the window and from the dash plus the power cord comes out too easily.  The unit deserves a five star rating but because of the mounting system and power cord coming out too easily a four star rating was provided. \n",
      "I would highly recommend reading the BusinessWeek review on this product that came out on September 12 2005.  BusinessWeek as reviewed all the major GPS navigation options on the market and ranks the Cobra NAV ONE 4500 as number one.  Here is an excerpt from the BusinessWeek article\"Cobra's NAV ONE 4500 and Garmin's StreetPilot 2720 which each sell for $800 to $1000 use a more straightforward approach. The traffic info travels along with FM radio broadcasts from Clear Channel stations in 48 of the top 50 markets. An FM antenna and receiver pick it off the air and feed it to the navigation system.\"\"I preferred the Cobra mostly for its big bright 5inch screen and its builtin radio receiver. (The Garmin receiver is $200 extra and needs to be installed between your car antenna and radio.) When you encounter traffic a popup on the screen and a voice give you three options Keep driving reroute me or give me a couple of new routes and let me pick one. \n",
      "If money was no object I would prefer the totally wireless headset phone however this has been a great alternative.  I have TMJ and activities like talking with the phone crooked in my neck while holding my toddler while preparing dinner compound my pain...go figure  I find that having the phone clipped on my hip with the cord hanging is kind of a pain but the product works great.  I have had no problems hearing anyone nor has anyone had difficulty hearing me.  The earpiece is comfortable and easy to get on and off even for someone with elfishly small ears like me  \n",
      "I've owned this headphone for about a year now and I've got to say after going through multiple headphones this beats all others I've tried. If this one ever broke (I doubt that'll happen anytime soon) I'll surely buy another one againPros Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses you won't feel uncomfortable. Clear treble middle and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time nonstop about 24 or 32 hours). Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studiolevel headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also it's single wire format.Cons Ear padding is perhaps too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although at first few weeks the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out look into getting inear canal type headphones instead. As some others have pointed out tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements. You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones so it's not a huge negative point. The headphone is quite big and on a small head you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.That's all I've got to say and overall this headset is definitely worth your money \n"

      "I think everyone knows that these drives have become invaluable.  Mine has become a necessitiy between my computers at work and at home and any where I can get an open computer.  I have W2K at home with USB 1 and XP Pro at work with USB 2.  Never had any type of compatibility issue.  This 128 MB size is the minimum most can get by with in my opinion.  I plan on upgrading to at least the 256 soon.The amazing this is that I have just removed my USB drive from a clean pair of pants that went through the wash and dry cycle.  And this was the second time.  I can't believe it still works.Maybe I'll have to start using that ridiculus cord and wear it around my neck.Through away your zip and floppy disks and get one of these things.

I love this thing I got it for Christmas and now for $20 you can't beat that. I use a standard charger for it in my car so I never have to worry about batteries. It seems that the best way to get it to sound the best is work with your mp3 player or whatever your using (equalizer). I have also used it on my portable DVD player in the car and it sounds awesome For the price I highly recommend this product \n",
      "I've used the keyboard/mouse for a little over a month now and have generally found it to do all I would wish. Of course any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.The only drawback and it is minor is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit. Yes it would draw down batteries more quickly but as an option it would be user selected.All in all a good wireless keyboard/mouse combination and one I am quite glad I purchased.Life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and wellpreserved body. But rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming\"WOW Lord What a ride\" \n",
      "I read about these headphones in a magazine and i was intrigued by the reviews. having a headphone fetish (odd i know) i decided to order them seeing that they were relatively inexpensive..  this is a decision i am thoroughly glad i made.  these little headphones are absolutely incredible and they even outmatch in quality my larger studiosize headphones i have at home.  the bass is the best i've ever heard in a headphone rich and deep and true. the mids and heights are also brilliantly emulated.  the mere fact  that it is portable with its own compact and innovative carrying case means that you can take the excellent sound with you wherever you go.  i definitely recommend these pones to anyone who values outstanding quality in their music and games.....5 stars  \n",

      "I was unsure at first if this product would work with my iPod nano but after checking out Griffin's website I decided to go ahead and order it.  It works great  I like to play Solitaire and read text files on my nano so the battery charge runs down much faster than it would if I didn't use the screen so much.  TuneJuice means I don't ever have to worry about that again.  I just keep a couple of 9V batteries with me and I can keep listening playing reading or whatever on my nano as long as I want.  Love it.I posted the above review on May 22 2006 after having had the TuneJuice for almost 3 weeks.  Two of those weeks were spent on vacation and this little gadget got a *lot* of use.  Now about 5 months after first receiving the TuneJuice I'm about to order my second one  to replace the first one.  I still love it and did get a *lot* of use out of it but snapping 9V batteries on and off so many times caused the wires leading from inside the battery compartment to the 'snaps' that connect to the battery itself to break off. Despite that I feel like I got my money's worth and I'm buying another one \n",
      "I have been using my Sandisk player with no problems downloading songs or pictures. I have also made some observations that makes this player function more efficently.use MTP music files because they use less file space.adjust the file size on pictures to use less memory.use the Speck toughskin case to protect display window (extra).use the AC Sandisk USB charger instead of the computer USB port(extra).I do not use the raio or the video settings because of no interest and the large amount of memory the video consummes.This player does fine using the earphones or hooked up to a audio center.I think that the 2MG card will be on my list of upgrades.The only upgrade I am made was to buy a better set of earphones. I did not like the pair supplied with the unit. My earphones have a volume control on the output cord which makes it much easier to control.I am not sorry about buying this item from Amazon. \n",

This hookup is MUCH better  I have a Monster Cable HDMI hooked up to the new receiver that runs to my Sony 46\" flat panel as well (more $ but....).  I'm finally satisfied.  I'm watching (and listening to) \"Batman Begins\" (In True HD sound) on HD DVD and it is superb  This is just awesome  The stuff of fantasy.

Customer service fixed that in a jiffy too.I have owned several multiple device remotes over the years and never had one so good that I could really put away all my other remotes. I now only use one  the Harmony 680. Fantastic device I'd give it 6 stars if I could \n",

When you can currently buy other computer accessories like a brand name 50pack of CDR's for less than $14 the profit margin on something like this is probably 200% or more \n",

      "I just recently move from dialup to DSL. Going DSL was not enough I did not want to have cables running though the house so I started looking into going wireless. To make a long story short after a little investigation I decided to make the leap into wireless technology. I purchased the WAP55AG router and the adapter cards WMP55AG and WPC55AG.Once the WAP55AG router was installed and set up the installation of the WMP55AG PCI Adapter on each of the desktops were simple.I had no difficulty setting up the hardware and software and with a few hours I was on the net through the router. One desktop is running XP professional and the other desktops are running XP Home edition. The LinkSys Web site has all the documentation you need for installation and setup. There is a \"Knowledge Base\" page that covers a lot of the products and answers to a lot of questions about various products and configurations I found it to be very helpful.Pulled from LinkSys Web SiteThe Linksys DualBand Wireless A+G PCI Adapter installs in most desktops and lets you put your computer almost anywhere in the building without the cost and hassle of running network cables. Now you don't have to drill holes in your walls and climb through the attic or cellar to get connected to the network. Once you're connected you can keep in touch with your email access the Internet use instant messaging to chat with friends and share files and other resources such as printers and network storage with other computers on the network. The DualBand Wireless A+G PCI Adapter connects you with WirelessA (802.11a) and WirelessG (draft 802.11g) networks at an incredible 54Mbps And for added versatility it can also interoperate with all the 11Mbps WirelessB (802.11b) products found in homes businesses and public wireless hotspots around the country. And whichever mode you choose your wireless communications are protected by up to 152bit encryption so your data stays secure.

      "I am very happy with this mouse and would recommend it to everyone.  It looks good but more importantly it feels good.  Button placement weight smoothness everything was done well.  Coming from wired mice the lack of a wire is very freeing.  I am also especially happy with how small the USB radio receiver is.  I am using this mouse on a laptop and love how inobtrusive it is.What's strange is I bought the S 530 desktop set for Mac at the same time.  The mouse in that set looks nearly identical (except for color).  However it has a different weight and simply doesn't feel quite as comfortable to use.  It only fits the hand the same but once you move it it lacks the same comfort and ease of use as this mouse \n",

      "I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B good/not great \n",
      "The Logitech Cordless TrackMan Wheel was purchased in Sept. 2006. I have had this for two months at the time this review is being written.I bought this to replace the corded version of the same item. The cordless works as well as the corded one. The trackball doesn't has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did but the difference is minimal. I wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use.I find the shape of the Logitech Trackman to fit the hand very naturally. It is also much less strenuous on the wrist than a normal mouse which is why I use it.I replaced the corded one so that we could easily move the mouse to different locations for use. This is for home use with multiple users with different mouse location preferences. I took the corded one to use at work where it still performs flawlessly 8+ hours a day.I also have a Logitech cordless keyboard.There are two places where both these items could be improved Each one of these items needs it own receiver. It would save some of my limited home desk space if these could be combined into one unit. I initially had the receivers out of sight behing an LCD monitor. I found that it was necessary to move them away from the monitor to get them to work reliably. This is a documented requirement in the owners manual but that necessity takes away from the convenience of the wireless. The receivers as stated earlier take up space I would rather not spare \n"

      "We have a TrackMan corded model and loved it so I got this one for my work computer.  It works just as well as the corded one when I'm in my office.  For travel the part you plug in is a little bulky so I usually leave it at home when I travel.  It's not a small USB stick that goes in the back.  It's a long corded mouse looking device that sends/recieves the signal to the TrackMan.  I don't think they market it as a portable device so it works just as advertised but it would be nice if it just had a USB stick instead of the other for travel.  All that said I love the trackball over a mouse so this is just perfect for me \n",

      "If you buy this service plan print out the contract and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.Some notes on the contract1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington DC but MINUS MAINE) but it does not include Guam Virgin Islands etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C. this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is if the manu. warranty is still good you have to use it.4. If the item needs to be shipped shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I'm uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect and a upon the time of a 4th repair as determined by them they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer's warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn't sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you  many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans (such as they don't cover accidents and they don't cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But in all seriousness read the list before you purchase.So now that I have summarized much of the contract if you want to get the service warranty PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN'T COVER EVERYTHING (Don't hold me liable since I don't have much money anyways.) Also I think this is typical in warranty contracts but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.Assuming they aren't jerks with their discretion and aren't too tough to deal with I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn't get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product being at the lower price end of the scale) \n",

      "I was hesitant to get this since other reviewers gave it poor ratings on reception.  Now that I bought it I'm very glad I have it.  It does all the things you might want in a disaster inluding a flashlight red flashing light (especially if your car breaks down at night) a siren (if you're trapped in a building) AC battery and crank power and multiple radio bands.  While some reviewers complained of not getting a lot of stations in a disaster you only need a few stations as everyone will be broadcasting disaster news.  Between the AM FM TV and NOAA bands my radio will received a huge number of stationsmany more than would ever be needed in a disaster.  (I didn't try the cellphone charging function.)  It comes in a carrying case.Only minor criticisms  The case seems like an afterthought  it doesn't hold the AC adapter the knobs tend to turn the radio on when putting it in the case and the knobs could get broken off if the case is hit (not that protective). However it comes in a strong box which is perhaps better storage for everything.Overall this is all you should need for light siren and broadcast information from multiple power sources in a disaster \n",

The V3m is slow to access \"My Music\" using menu function #3 under \"Get Tunes &amp Tones\".  Function #6 \"Manage Music\" accesses the library reasonably quickly and works well.  The new corded Motorola SYN1301B stereo earbuds work well in this configuration.  Sound quality is surprisingly good but the large diameter earbuds are flat...not tapered... and do not seat very well in the ear canal.

As I start to approach the bridge I start getting a small KBand warning. I instantly slow down to the speed limit. As I start crossing the bridge the warning keeps increasing so I slow down even more to 35 mph. Then it gets to full KBand. I look to my left where there is a service parking area and in the pitch dark I see the reflectors of the one and only Crown Vic Police Car. As I pass the police car I start flashing all the oncoming cars to tell them that there is a cop ahead.  If I didn't have this detector he would have gotten me doing 20 over the limit. Thank you Escort \n",
      "This is my second Escort Passport 8500 X50. The first one is in another car. It saved me many times for getting caught though I'm not maniac driver. The detection range is very good it gives you plenty time to adjust your speed before you see the police car. I love the blue color and it only costs $30 more than red. The only problem that I have experienced on my first one is sometimes I got laser false warning signals especially on raining day with defog is on. I heard someone mentioned that turbo charged car can causes X50 Pop and Laser false warning signals and my first X50 is in my turbo charged car. I'm not sure if Pop alerts were false but since it won't help much I have it turned off. Overall it's very good detector you will get payback if you own one.  \n",

      "I got mine to work in about 30 min following S Huffs directions below (followed exactly).  There was only one thing not mentioned that I had to do to get it to work.  Once you get into the settings on the range extender to enable WEP and put in the key and passphrase I had to turn WEP back on on my router before saving the settings on the range extender.  Basically just put step 6 before you save settings in step 5 this is what worked for me at any rate.I've had it for about 4 months now and it has worked as advertised.  I gave it 4 stars because set up was still kind of a pain.From S Huff The tips that Anthony Taylor left helped me get it working... but I still had some issues. I've added onto his tips from his review below 1Disable WEP on your Router or AP 2Hold the autoconfiguration button for 30 seconds(if everything goes well both lights on the expander will turn blue) and unplug while still holding button. Plug back in after 1015 secs. 3open your Internet explorer browser and type 192.168.1.240 (default ip of expander) a window will pop up. leave the user name blank and put admin as a password (this is default password). 4make sure that the default gateway and subnet mask settings are identical with your Router or APchange password on the expander if desired &amp save settings. (all settings should be correct due to auto configuration) 5Enable WEP on the expander once again remember use same settings that you will be putting in your router or AP in step 6  aka same passphrase) save settings again. 5.5  As soon as you enable WEP on your expander  you will loose your connection to it as it's now setup for WEP and your router isn't  keep this in mind  drove me nuts. 6Go to your Router or Ap settings and enable WEP. 7  UNPLUG your expander for 10 to 15 seconds and plug it back in  Bang you're DONE.

      "I have always had uniden cordless telephone and have always liked them.  I had purchased this one to replace my 2.4ghz uniden cordless telephone which would interfere with my wireless modem on my computer.  This one doesn't.  I also like the feature of the intercom feature.  My daughter has one of the handsets downstairs in her room and if she isn't on the phone I can contact her to talk to her.  My daughter also likes the mute feature where she can put somebody on hold if she is on the phone to ask me a question so that person on the other end doesn't hear her.The phone has many other features but those are 2 usefule ones I like along with the caller ID \n",

      "I needed a simple solution for my office. I wanted to be able to use the phone but not get tied down by the handset or the headset. Here was my solution Since the TS105B has the 2.5mm port for a headset I purchased a Jabra A210 Bluetooth adapter along with this phone and used one of my spare bluetooth headset to stay on conference calls and yet be able to move around my office. So far... WOW its worked out great. The phone is also good by itself plus it was inexpensive through AMAZON. For anyone interested in going the route I took... you will not be disappointed. Oh yes... you are limited to about 25 ft or in my case as I work in a hospital where there are alot of other signals and lead lined walls... 15ft with max length at about 20 before you begin to hear static. The phone was a great buy as was the Jabra A210 adapter.   \n"

      "I have had this TV since MidMarch 2006. I absolutley love it I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.As far as where to buy it I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon's price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product \n",
      "There is a little story before thisI bought a pair of Sony MDRXD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that even at full volume on the player it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.On with the reviewYes there is a slight hiss but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 23 ft (IE on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue.It also does a great job of amplifying the signal it works very well I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half my headphones start to distort.If your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course the hiss but it isn't too loud &amp I can live with it.I reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer \n",
      "This does what it's advertized too.  I like not having wires.  The iPod in my bag and just the headset.  It would be a bit better if you could control the power on the ipod from the headset ie turn off the headset receiver and ipod all from the headset.  Instead I have to get the ipod back out turn it off turn the receiver off then turn the headset off.Otherwise the sound is good and the headset hasn't broken for me yet \n",
      "I picked up 4 pairs of these on Amazon and have applied the CA and Nylon tape fix to the first pair (took about 10 minutes to do let it cure overnight).  Headphones look ok with just the right amount of Geekhood proudly announced afterwards (reminiscent of the last generation of Geeks with the tape on the glasses).  Sound is very good (better than most earbuds) they establish link quite quickly with the dedicated Logitech transiever and range is outstanding.  My only beef is how long I have to hold down the power switch to turn them on and so far I have not successfully established a connections with my Treo 650.  1 star held back because of need of customer applied ECO and they are only partially functional with the Nano (can't use the advance track feature of the headphones) \n",
      "I am ordering my third of this capacity and have one in the 200 capacity range from Case Logic.  This is a great product and is manufactured well.  Holds the discs well and is easy to take them in and out.  I don't transport them so I can't comment on that.  Like others have said it is not easy if you want to move pages around but you can do it and it does make it nice for organizing as you fill it up.  Get this if you need a lot of storage \n",
      "This headphone extension is perfect  It is not as long as described (about 15 feet) but that's O.K. with me.  The connections are tight (the plugs don't pull apart).  It maintains sonic quality.  It also retains it's elasticity.  Using this extension cord my Grado SR60's sound better than any wireless phones.  You won't be dissapointed  \n",
      "This is a pretty decent cheapo case.  If you want something that you'll use every day in the car or at your DJ gigs then you may want to get something a little sturdier.  For my [archival] purposes however it works just fine \n",
      "Purchase/ServiceFor $2200 at Amazon this was a great purchase since it would have cost over $2700 at a retail store (including tax and shipping).  Eagle arrived 10 days earlier than the Amazon estimate unloaded the TV right to the TV stand and after hooking it up and making sure the controls worked and the picture / sound worked I signed for it.  And Eagle asked if I wanted the packaging carted away.Very pleased with the service part so far.....My SetupS6187 61\" HDTVSony AV and 5.1 surround (this is not a digital unit.....I wasn't sure it would work but there are three options to hookup a home theater 1) Basic connection 2) Optical 3) HDMI)Sony DVDMotorola HDCATV box (We use Comcast)Sony VCRExperienceAs far as the tv the HD channels look sharp and clear however the non HD channels aren't as sharp as my 36\" Sony CRT TV (there are several settings on the Samsung for 169 43 and wide format setting to 43 or wide for non HD channels improves the picture quality a little).  But it doesn't effect the enjoyment since I purchased this for the HD and it blows me away.The TV controls are simple to use and the on screen menu's are easy to navigate.  The sound out of the TV is not adequate for surround sound but I hooked up a 5.1 reciever and it makes HD come to life.I like the fact that you can connect components to an AV and/or the TV so there is room for 3 additional components with my setup.  I also hooked up my laptop (there is 2 connections for the video and audio on the back of the TV).  After changing the video settings on the Laptop (the mannual does a nice job for XP users) it was incredible   The camcorder hooks up to the side of the TV so there is no need to move the unit away from the wall.  It was a simple setup and again the picture quality just blew me awayI highly recommend this TV to anyome looking for a 50\" plus TV \n",

      "It is remarkable that even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence none of them are nearperfect.  I tried four different cases both hard plastic and silicone variants and the iskin case comes the closest protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.The case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the doubleseam in the silicone the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod so you don't have to worry about it scratching.The case even has a flap that covers the dock connector preventing dust from entering yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.The most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling.  Actually I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.The only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with itI would not trust it at all so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well but as I said above I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases this one does also attract lint in your pockets etc. but it is not as bad as other cases.Unfortunately even though this is a great case it is not readily available.  I couldn't find it in any store and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers.  I ordered from Applelinks and they delivered it to me in four days.  Whatever you do don't order from the iSkin company directly.  I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases.  They should rededicate themselves to manufacturing these great iskins and let others worry about selling them \n",

An HP 100 cartridge can be usedfor black and white photos. Yes the color cartridge must beexchanged for the black one when converting from color toblack and white and vise versa.

      "I tried both Microsoft's LifeCam VX3000 and VX6000. Had 'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and with both of those the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file installed it but the VX6000 still produced outofsync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. So I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my I believe excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB's price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place including of course here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset which I haven't used so far.Although I haven't tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a \"USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing\" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on get this the Microsoft cams I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX3000 in all other criteria too in my opinion after comparison testing.The Orbit's special effects are interesting and fun. The pan tilt etc. excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive  fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn  but I haven't tested in actual live conferencing yet.All in all  for webcams I'm now saying what more experienced webcam users told me  head for Logitech. They've certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And my advice to Microsoft you'd better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I've relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals keyboards etc. and I've generally been very satisfied. But in webcams with me the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech. \n",

      "Garmin iQue M5I'm very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it's not perfect it's pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.It has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device as it isn't very intuitive and the manuals especially for the PDA are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS and he's learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It's very sophisticated and the maps are great  better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it the voice directions are clear and concise and it reroutes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites and you can be on your way if you've viewed your route before starting out.I used the GPS on a trip Stratford Canada and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bedandbreakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left which would have taken me into the Avon River) but it's generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted the iQue doesn't always take you on the shortest route but it will get you where you're going and if you're \"directionally challenged\" like I am it becomes indispensible.The car mounting bracket works fine.  It's popped off occasionally in hot weather but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cupholder if you needed to use it in a rental car.I've spent more time learning the PDA portion which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface so you'll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it which was helpful.  The PDA has so many functions that it's hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts checks email accesses the Internet if you get a WiFi card recognizes handwriting has a voice recorder interfaces with other Bluetooth units sends alarms has Word and Excel even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003 including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I'd find much use for a PDA but I'm using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handydandy little machine. And even though it isn't that intuitive once you've learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.We've called Garmin Tech Support a few times and although they are only open during regular business hours we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product.  Since a good GPS will run at least [...] this was a great bargain at around [...]  We've purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won't wear out too quickly as I've heard Palm Pilots tend to do.  I'm really enjoying the iQue. \n",
      "We bought this about a month ago from Amazon.  The product itself seems fine  we used it on a vacation drive from NJ to Myrtle Beach and back.  At times it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also it was missing certain stores restaurants etc. that had been around for awhile.We liked that it is a PDA though.  My husband drives limos so he wanted a mapping device for help but we hope to load some games into it.  This way when he has to wait around he will have something to do.  CONS  You should be techsavvy to get one of these set up Match sure you get patches as unit will lock up Manufacturer has DISCONTINUED this model.  They still offer some support but be warned that this is a DISCONTINUED model. Since it became DISCONTINUED it dropped in price about $60 two weeks after I bought it which annoys me somewhat Will be spending extra to get bigger memory card Came with EXPIRED Outlook coupon  why bother including this?PROS Nice display and controls Came with mount and dock (some don't  you have to buy extra) We had no trouble with the suction cup mount (had to pry it off the window with a knife one time) but agree that most placement seems to block driver view through windshield Also a PD \n",
      "This phone was an additional phone for the Model IP8112 phone system used for Vonage. This system has every feature that I could want including range and quality there are no negatives. I am highly recommending this phone and system \n",
      "Not much said about the fantastic quality of the video picture. You wouldn't think that you would actually be able to watch video on a screen this small but the resolution and quality of the picture is amazing. I have shown it to an IPod owner and was told the video on this player is definately better than the IPod.The unit is not perfect it does freeze occasionally but the reset function has always unlocked it. The video sometimes converts in a jerky fashion also. But the conversion software was able to handle very large files. I suspect a little tweaking might fix the conversions.Sound quality is great. Combine this with Sennheiser CX300B Earbuds and you'll love it.This is my forth MP3 type player amd the extra money over the lower end players definately yields a better product. The previous player Creative Zen Nano Plus 1 GB MP3 quit working the week the warranty ran out.Thumbs up on this one \n",
      "I purchased this cable solely to connect my GPSmap 76S to my HP laptop.  So far it has performed perfectly.  I have not tried to use it for other applications yet so I can't comment on how well it would work in other situations.  \n",

      "The zen micro is brilliant I have dropped it a load of times and it still works fine i've dropped it on the kitchen tiles twice i've dropped it a few times in the yard and it still works perfect. I had to buy new headphones for it which made the sound quality much better. It is very easy to transfer files to it I always use windows media player to transfer files as it is easier to use than the creative software. I use it everyday and the battery lasts a good while for me.Overall the zen micro is a very good product \n",

      "I bought this screen as a replacement for my 8ms 17\" Hyundai L90D+(which is a great lowpriced screen for gaming) which was the replacement for a Dell fp2100 (that I gave to my wife). Anyways this is an excellent monitor with excellent color reproduction and response times (more than enough for my flight sims). Movies are beautiful and the rather weird resolution hasn't been a problem. The design is probably the neatest looking out there (subjective I realize). The ONLY gripe I have w/ this monitor is lack of swivel (sigh). Other than that I'm very pleased with everything about this screen \n",
      "Wow...just got one of these at a great price hooked it up to my Mac G4 via a DVID cable and it boots up at native resolution (1680 x 1050) automatically  no muss no fuss. Text is crisp and clean \n",
      "My favorite thing about this phone is that the caller ID captures 11 digit numbers (1xxxxxxxxxx) which are then very easy to store into the phone book and call.  My old phone only captured 10 digits (xxxxxxxxxx) which meant I had to reenter everything manually because of course you have to dial a 1 first.  This new phone also allows me to toggle between 11 digits and 7 digits on the same number.  I put together my phone book just by capturing calls as they came in.  Very handy.  As far as being a phone it does everything well and after a couple of months I am still as happy as could be with it \n",

      "This is my first GPS and I wanted a unit that could be used in a variety of environments such as biking hiking kayaking and in the car to. I found this unit to be easy to use with a large display and convenient controls. Also the 2 times I called Garmin with questions I was able to talk to someone who is in the USA as opposed to a person in a foreign country which can be frustrating to some. On the down side to get the most out of this unit you still need to buy additional mapping software \n",
      "Ok.. here's the deal.  I've been an avid Magellan user for the past 3 years.  I love my Magellan.  I've never liked the Garmins because of their clumsy interface (the buttons placed above the display NEVER made sense to me) and how the menu structure was built.  However.... We're planning a 2000 mile road trip from Utah up to the Oregon coast.  We needed something with expandable memory so we could upload more than one state map at a time.  My wife bought me the Magellan eXplorist 600 for Fathers Day.  I forced myself to use it for two days (and believe me it was torture).  I could go on and on about why I sent it back.  What I ordered as a replacement was the GPSMap 60Cx.  Now keep in mind that I felt like someone who had turned to the dark side.  I couldn't be happier with my decision.  While I agree with most of the other reviews about the lack of base maps and the expense of additional ones this unit ROCKS  It acquires satellites within seconds.  It has expandable memory.  It has a color screen.  It manages Geocaches.  It autoroutes.  It stores 1000 waypoints.  It has SiRF Technology.  It is a USB interface.  It has a belt clip.  It changes display contrast at night (automatically).  It slices...  It dices....Suddenly the Dark Side isn't so darkThis is a great unit that I would recommend to anyone.  \n",
      "I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player but I did NOT want an iPod as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006 and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.Like many rechargeable batterypowered items it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.I installed the software on my computer and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). It came preloaded with 20 songs only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those noname bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.As far as performance goes it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there you will be scrolling a lot.  I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music fm radio photo voice video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files I have not had any problems although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded but when you try to play it it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also you can only store a song as one genre which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player you cannot change the genre.It came with a headset but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything so I don't know what caused this but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation just the aesthetics.Overall the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod \n",
      "Pros Easy to use last for days without charging (depending on the use of course... but i was traveling for 5 days and used it a lot without charging and it lasted the trip) enough memory space has radio works as a recorder smallCons Stopped working froze twice since i bought it 3 month ago. When it's on tunes that i had deleted will still appear on my play list. If I hit play on such song the player just skips and plays the next song on the list. But overall i'm happy with my MP3. I'd recommend it \n"

      "I've never written a review but I've relied heavily upon the voluntary opinions of other Amazon buyers so I felt a really good product like the Anycom Bluetooth mouse deserves an unsolicited review.I know experience and taste vary by individual but this mouse is awesome from my viewpoint.Pros Bluetooth  connects immediately provides smooth accurate tracking Size  very portable some may find it too narrow I have a hardtime going back to a wider mouse Battery life  I get at least 2 days out of it before charing and I'm a fairly heavy user USB charge attachment  allows you to continue to work while recharging Product Design/Quality  Nicely engineered good quality material not tinny  it's built to take abuseCons Haven't really found any  It took me awhile to figure out how to connect until I read the manual line by line (I don't tend to do that) then I realized it was pretty straight forward.If you're looking for a quality bluetooth traveling mouse this is the one. \n",
      "I was in the market for a new inkjet and finally settled on this printer. The photo output is awesome and it's very fastThere are only two things I would comment on that new users might not be aware of. I was ready to return the printer as I thought it was defective until I found out what the problems were.1) When the cartridges dry out it will tell you that the cartridges are incompatible. This was confusing as I did have the correct cartridges in the printer. A \"replace cartridge\" message would have been less ambiguous.2) The printer has so far appeared \"dead\" once. When I went to turn it on it would not do so. The solution is on HP's website  you must remove the rear door and do a hard reset. I did this and the printer worked fine again.The printer does not come with a USB cable but those can be easily bought for $1420. \n",
      "I'm a skeptic. No I mean I'm REALLY a skeptic... especially in today's marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don't buy anything without checking it out first and even then I expect that it's probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah wonderful view there huh?Well needless to say I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn't fail me out of the box. I've been using my speedpad for almost a year now and I have to say that it has been by far more solid responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now that's how well this gamepad has worked for me.Here are the ins and outs1) Solid construction. As others have stated this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This alone surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all)... so I'm glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.2) Software. Do yourself a favor when you get this device home don't bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead go directly to Belkin's website firstthing download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what's on the CD but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you'll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.I've had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that's generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin's programmers on writing the software suite for this they did a good job.4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product basically what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad and I've never had it happen since. 5) Other buttons. * The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance and I don't use it much at all because it's hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). * The orange button above the dpad also isn't that easy to press though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage it's not impossible to press this button (in fact I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It's perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.* I haven't experienced any problems hitting the 'space' button below the dpad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can't simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key I have to actually lift my thumb off the dpad to do it  and that's not much of a complaint at all really.The dpad itself is a godsend I'm a true console gamer having used nothing but dpads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). Dpad is all I know really. In fact the one thing that's kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I've never ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual dpad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. As I said at the top of this review I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven't and that I really needed  a controller interface that's actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I'm using it most of the time allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I'm playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place isn't it? The Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who's looking for the type of benefits I've listed. And for that matter I'm recommending it right now in fact... \n",

      "The antenna works well and obtains more satellites than the GPS units internal antenna. This easily solved the issue of poor reception when the GPS is inside of a car however the best accuracy I am able to obtain is 13 feet with this external antenna vs. the 9 feet using the GPS's internal antenna when in an open area.

Depending on type of your iPAQ (1900 series vs 3000 series) you might have varying degrees of comfort trying to shove your PDA into the case.  Once you're done however it's very easy to use and carry.  It comes with a belt clip that you may or may not use.  The case itself is slim enough to fit snugly in your pocket unlike so many other cases.  The obvious disadvantage is that if you drop it on a hard surface this case won't provide much in a way of side protection (klutzes be warned).  The leather feels surprisingly good almost a lambskin kind of quality.  The credit card space is not very useful but you can shove a couple of business cards in there.

      "Great sound quality great signal quality.  I can hear everyone well and the people on the other end of the call can also hear me well.  The main charging station is about 40 feet away at the opposite end of the house from my farthest charger with a couple walls in between and I have no problems with signal.The handsets are smaller than I expected but that's actually a bonus since I hadn't bought a new phone in a while and thought my old handset was too big and clunky.  The handsets are about 6 inches long not including the antenna part 1 and 7/8 inches at the widest point by the display and 1 and 1/8 inches thick at the thickest point.Doesn't interfere with my wireless internet or any of my other electronics.  I've used the phone while sitting next to my laptop while both I and the chargers were next to TV and stereos and with my cell phone going at the same time  no interference.The speakerphone part isn't that great  the person on the other end can hear other sounds in the room plus they say it sounds like I'm speaking from a great distance away.  But I've never had a phone with a good speakerphone so wasn't expecting that to work anyway.Would have been great if they'd included a headset that goes with it since the handsets do have headset jacks.  I love the extra handsets that only need to be plugged into a power outlet  solved my lack of working jacks problemThe display lights up when it rings and when you press any of the keys.  The keys are not backlit.  The menus are fairly intuitive  if you've ever had a cell phone you can figure this out pretty easily.  It's very easy to send phone numbers that you've programmed into one handset to all the other handsets or only to a specific handset.When I first hooked everything up the phones got no dial tone but the problem was with the phone cord that plugs into the phone jack in the wall.  For some reason the cord they provided didn't work so when I swapped it out with the cord I had all the phones worked fine.I'd buy these again and recommend to others to buy \n",
      "This is definitely a comfortable mouse if you don't have big hands. It is a pretty small mouse but it contours very nicely even if you are lefthanded. The extra buttons are handy for lazy people like me who don't like using the keyboard or clicking on buttons to go forward backward and switch between programs. The button in the middle though (the one that lets you switch programs) is out of the way. It takes just a bit more effort to use meaning that you would have to remove your hand from the default contour to use that button. I actually hardly ever use that button. I can't live without the forward/backward buttons though. I find myself manhandling other mice thinking they too have those neat little buttons. The mouse has a really good response to movement as well. I've used it for gaming as well though I admit I'm not a hardcore gamer. I really recommend this mouse.

Instead of spelling Hoover Street you just type Hoover and it will give you a list of the possible locations.

      "Obviously there are far better printers on the market.  But if you're looking for a quality 3inone in the $100 to $150 range this one seems to be at the top of the pack.There are nicer printers out there in this price range.  However you will be severely penalized when it comes to purchasing ink.  HewlettPackard printers tend to be the most friendly when it comes to buying refilled cartridges or refilling your own cartridges.It prints fast it prints well and I enjoy the doublesided printing feature.  This printer has been consistently rated by users as being accurate in its color prints although I've done little color printing myself.The scans are not the greatest as they leave small artifacts at regular intervals when you zoom in in Photoshop.  The artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels.  They're not really noticeable to the naked eye and you won't see them unless you're editing the picture and have blown it up considerably.  Still it's probably not the best for archiving your photos. (I expect there's a bur on the plastic gear that rolls down the rack &amp pinion)However flaws are to be expected in this price range and the listed flaws of this printer are nominal.  Given my research two months ago and performance I've encountered after purchasing this printer and the ease with which I was able to refill the ink cartridges I'd say this is the best printer you can buy for $100(as of Nov 2006) if you don't want to be extorted into paying exorbitant ink prices for say an Epson \n",

I have both the Canon Photo Plus Glossy and the Photo Pro papers. If you are looking to print out very impressive photos then I would recommend getting the 8x10 Photo Plus Glossy  definitely nice enough to frame. And with Plus glossy you're definitely saving $ instead of paying $$$ to have professional photos done at a professional or retail store. And I even scanned a professional photo that I had done last year with my MP500 and printed using Plus Glossy and the print is significantly better than the original. Pros Best Value Canon has to offer. Great great prints my favorite paper overall. As good as Pro and less expensive.

There may be a benifit to the \"Pro\" paper that cannot be seen (lasts longer?) but at almost twice the cost it is not worth it  this paper will produce the highest quality prints on your Canon printer (I think they look better than the ones I get from the photo lab) \n",

       " 'My new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs all day every day and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.My cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK the video of one contributor was poor and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.The quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.Setup was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10000 ft. above sea level.I was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kickoff.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks and then in Denver for another week before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.All in all a great set at a great price I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner ',\n",
       " 'So I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck it wouldn\\'t work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn\\'t find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn\\'t matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It\\'s not a nightandday difference but it\\'s a noticeable improvement. Sure I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weakersignaled LX mode not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better stronger signal. This product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it\\'s control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I\\'ll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. My recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already as I do a lot of driving* I say If you can buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it\\'s not an option and you don\\'t want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup this is a viable solution indeed.

It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I'm drawing my finger frequently hits it because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet it is nice to have if you have the desk space.

       " \"I wouldn't be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn't have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That's all there is to it that's what it does and it does it well. On the down side and it's a small and transient down side actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you'd sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick security wise is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don't like the attachment to the neck strap I don't like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.I use this on a 20d which typically has a 24200 or 80400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don't have an issue. If Canon read this you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price you normally pay close attention to detail and it's a bit lacking here \",\n",

One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs  other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.One of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVDRAM.  They are rerecordable for many many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVDRAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVDRAM.

Wireless Access Point (its default setup)2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them  acts as one end of a \"virtual\" cable you need two to get the job done)A pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian\\'s comment that this wouldn\\'t work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.1. I understand that higherend more expensive equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well it\\'s not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.3. Something that 99% of the world won\\'t care about  I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do lowlevel analysis of the box and the network it\\'s attached to. I think there are thirdparty firmware loads that enable this ',\n",

I don\\'t know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can\\'t trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver even if you made them yourself so don\\'t think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.Also the molding where the linein input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.I\\'ve had mine for just over a year now and use it every day whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.

I have tried backpacks shoulder bags duffel bags but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches vests belts and accessories. It works great you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) The variety alone of this system is worth the investment but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens camera body or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch because sometimes the lens will fit but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 56 lenses extension tubes teleconverters extra memory cards and batteries and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. The only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don't need to take all of your equipment which is nice.

I agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items  but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime) then buff then repair.

Unless you need HDMI the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy secure connection.  Lots of component video SVHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  Really easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.Did I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich  great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.Best of all my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.The end result  I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver ',\n",

       " 'The Sony SSMF650H are a lowcost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.Though I have not had the opportunity to test the ultrahigh (up to 50kHz) frequency the highs on these speakers sound very well maybe only slightly boxy  note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.The sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However don\\'t get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.The bass is very punchy and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers as their highs are very good and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the subwoofer... don\\'t worry low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won\\'t suffer). In other words you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their outofthe box quality.Ignore the 50kHz rating for ultrahighfrequency sound as a positive feature as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz  20kHz at a reasonable RMS.You get what you pay for... for the price tag on them the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound) and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity  especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them) the sound quality suffers.I would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you\\'re willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.I also demoed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady but excellent for the price  seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you\\'re looking for deep and bassheavy sound without a subwoofer and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SSMF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though so if you have a big room shop around for something better. ',\n",

When I got home I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8VX motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW  I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.I do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.Overall I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.When it comes to music I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer) so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.Very good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong. I highly recommand them for computer users (music DVD movies and games) ',\n",

Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries which only lasted about 15 hours of use) while the iTrip worked OK at first but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then it was still not clear). The sound isn't as loud as some (it takes over the volume control so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still it's not nearly as soft as some I've seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit although it seems cheap and flimsy at first is able to get a consistant strong signal even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle but once you set the 3 presets you don't need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 123 configuration. Also turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all I couldn't be happier \",\n",

The reason behind that is because they\\'re truly excellent headphones. The range is spectacular and the inputs even more so. You\\'re given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical) which is all you really need. Movies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind in front and to your left and right when you\\'re connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds \\'boomier\\' and a tad crisper than Dolby D does especially in Gladiator. Honestly I\\'ve nothing to complain about. As a college guy I couldn\\'t bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which I might add never sounded as good as my headphones mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You\\'d be amazed at Coldplay\\'s \"The Scientist\" if you heard it on these headphones.

The sound is crisp with some static interference which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car's antenna helps a little but doesn't completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.There is nothing to mount the iPod so you'll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately.I wouldn't spend more than $45 on any FM transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas.

       " \"I have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase extra 1100mAh battery and auto power cord.Strengths Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies photos games word processing and anything else I can throw at it.  The other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  The battery life is phenomenal even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  WiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected it keeps the signal well and is while not fast reasonable for speedJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.Weaknesses Not enough programs to start with Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP it's way better)Problems Don't use Odyssey Client it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also in ActiveSync On the PDA select Menu Add Server Source.  On all of the screens put random characters in each field and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu options and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.Conclusion An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well \",\n",

The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich loud enough and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers the Traveldock has the best bass to date in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative's website).  I'm very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use which are on the back of the unit.  Also the Microphoto charges while docked whether it's playing or not.  There's even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3's adjust volume and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto. \",\n",

       " \"Echoing most other reviews here this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk If you don't wear these earphones correctly they sound terrible easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven't put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.Learning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips Before inserting the earbuds draw the phones up from behind your ear holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially) so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is swallow) just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.It may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does and success is not guaranteed.  But it's worth it And to save your hearing don't forget to turn down the volume since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise \",\n",

Now these earphones are incredibly lightweight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  These headphones are called \"asymmetric\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn\\'t spill on the wire.I paid about 60 bucks and for that price I love these headphones.  Face it these are low to midrange in terms of price but perform more like midrange to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.

I don\\'t know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive and of course it sounds great but these cables sound great too.  Plus these cables ARE Monster cables AND they are THX certifiedWhat does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology offering products and services of unparalleled quality for postproduction distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"A digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable it uses light to transmit the digital data it doesn\\'t degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables they just are going be a little less durable and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).Overall I\\'m very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver TV Cable Box Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)(P.S. for first time users don\\'t forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.

Thankfully the same time I read that Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15 after mailin rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far not bad... My laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I\\'ll admit the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often) you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibbleif you really wanted to you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise\" which you don\\'t really notice until you purposely try to listen for it The high setting on the other hand is a bit loud and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually though I only use the high setting when it\\'s really hot in the room or if I\\'m running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game.

The low end is there but for full effect it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves this sweet spot is not very wide. That said however I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bassrich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn't permit for either big speakers or special chambers maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason i didn't give it five stars.Also the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) &amp RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn't realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.Riding while using them can be dangerous since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead.

Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the onscreen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers It will play mp3s CDs computer made DivX movies Region 1 DVDs Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer\\'s codes which they list in a handy guide.

It\\'s smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.It holds a little less than 1000 songs due to different formatting but it\\'s still a good amount iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs raher than as on my brother\\'s mp3 player needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine and does it\\'s job my one complaint on that would be that as I mainly use it on the bus at 600 am it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.Another huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod \"family\" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them.

       " \"These are some great headphones with a few minor flawsPros1. Great sound quality2. Very comfortable3. Light4. Worryfree chargingCons1. Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy could require pressing the tunein button several times2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)My experience I've had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So overall wonderful product. However there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this you have to press the only button (power search and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it's not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well I hope my description is helpful. Regardless of the flaws I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep.  \",\n",
       " \"I have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd's.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system this MUST be taken into account.    First off this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn't 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bidirectional midrange speakers the subwoofer unit and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white silver black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). What brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any soundgranted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  Once I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong toa very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  Since I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver but when that was all said and done I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tagits target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  My test soundtracks included  Gladiator Matrix (II or III) Snatch and music tracks ranging from techno rock classical and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low high and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren't drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  All in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.Good  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy setup.  Well built speakersaesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.Bad  Subwoofer awkward no dedicated center channel pricey no included receiver.For their size these speakers more than compete with any fullblown tower 5.1 system.

       " 'Ladies and GentlemenJust a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy \\'toys\\' before exploring what it is that they\\'re buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is thata The U3 software has a way of stopping the software\\'s autoboot.b There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com and I\\'m guessing that those company\\'s that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the \\'Uninstaller\\' on their site.c There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and payforit) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site so do Verbatim &amp Memorex.d For those who want portable software but don\\'t want U3 or don\\'t have a U3 drive go to http//portableapps.com.  Note some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks without using the U3 LaunchPad.e Quality of drives remember that when you buy most of the electronics \\'toys\\' available today you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods also selling with NoName labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC and the destruction of goods that don\\'t meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life ya gets whats ya pay for.g Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0 et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent \\'rollback\\' feature.  And also the reason many if not MOST power users run multiple machines.  Of course these days we have to fill Billy G\\'s pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my poweruser friends run at least three or four machines each one with a different use.  It shouldn\\'t be this way but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software for many purposes (MP3\\'s scanning Video controlling radios composing music et al) one machine won\\'t cut it because XP ain\\'t as stable as folks think.  The more programs and the more varied in type the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003 because there are less software \\'toys\\' that run under 2K and the \\'admin\\' can prevent you from loading a lot of software \\'toys\\'.h In the end understand what you are buying before you buy so that you\\'ll have better luck getting what you want and you won\\'t look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong or just plain stupid.i When you truly understand the product you\\'ll be able to write TRULY useful reviews and that what all readers want useful information.To one and all may your \\'toys\\' keep you happy ',\n",

       " 'I recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. The E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. I am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. I also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.My biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes not as good as the E20s but still very good. As I write I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi\\'s 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan the BPO and AnneSophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volumepretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. I bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response and I liked the Advents Over time our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded ',\n",

       " 'First off let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors three Samsung models two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic but for my taste and needs the Samsungs are simply too bright and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light daytime use I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.Installation was simple in fact something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that interestingly again the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on I truly do not think the picture was as clear or the graphics as rich as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But and this is another tip for new users of this product the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal if not fully equal to those on the other LCDs that I own.One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included so you save that added expense (this isn\\'t true with all ViewSonics).  And especially with the digital connection I have no doubts about ViewSonic\\'s claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn\\'t sure I needed a widescreen display but I believe it\\'s going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones  This is a really a fine monitorNow for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven\\'t purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I\\'m comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn\\'t worry about it on this monitor was because while there are speakers they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example on the 17 inch Samsung monitor the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It\\'s not bad but it\\'s going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails other monitor stands are available.As with most electronic products these days there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard selfexplanatory things.  However I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer\\'s website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems surprisingly.All in all I\\'m very impressed so far and I\\'m really looking forward to using this monitor  By the by shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast it shipped the next day and it arrived the day after that.  I can\\'t complain about that speed  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure  Anyway a solid four stars for this monitor ',\n",
       " \"I'm using this AP along with a Netgear 802.11g PC Card to test streaming live/recorded TV to other parts of my house.  Seems like a capable product even if I didn't use the 108Mbps feature.However be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network's DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.I noticed that there is are hordes of wireless APs around my house I guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well.  However this DLink AP is able to function correctly abeit all the other APs around (2 using the same channel as mine I've found).Overall recommended if you want a good AP.  Just be sure to update the firmware \",\n",
       " \"The sound quality is pretty darn good except that if you pace around while talking/listening there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite and if you stand still they go away.  I've had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking  at least this phone doesn't do that.  My 900 MHz DSS Uniden didn't have these sounds (while pacing or otherwise) and still had greater range.  I don't know why the new technology can't measure up.  Still though this is the best 5.8 I've tried.  (Yet I'd rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore.  All of today's 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)Another annoying thing is that you can't recharge the phone with the belt clip attached so the clip goes on and off (and on and off).  (Many (cell) phones have a charger that allows this.)The plastic is a bit cheap.  Don't drop this phone.  My friend has one and it hasn't worked since it was dropped.(I haven't tried the bluetooth yet and have yet to see how good the battery life is. \",\n",

You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all after owning the tv for about 2 months now I couldn\\'t be happier.   To get around the poor speakers I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  I\\'ve also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42\" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.

       " \"I had a Zen VisionM but I returned it because I decided I didn't need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player so I decided to go with the Zen V since it's interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M's(which I liked).The first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn't that impressed but it's really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.The music is organized your standard ArtistAlbumSong interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still it's as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hitormiss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  The player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer album art will not be attached to the music tracks.If you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bitrate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player half as much as advertised.  SummaryProsExcellent physical designEasy to use interfaceGood navigationGreat sound qualityConsOnthego playlist creation is flawedAlbum art support hitormissSlow transfer speeds from WMP11Accesories rarely available in brickandmortar storesUltimately I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it's vastly superior physical design.  \",\n",

       " 'I read the other reviews for these speakers so I had very high expectations. I can only say WOW The premium price (compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems) is absolutely justified ',\n",
       " 'For reference I\\'ve owned a set of Labtec APX6420 2.1 speakers for about 67 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers I recall sampling Altec Lansing Logitech Klipsch Bose Creative and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.I initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1\\'s because of the fantastic reviews they\\'ve gotten on Amazon and elsewhere but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly) along with reports of buzzing the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer my impression of them in stores and experience with a friend\\'s ProMedia 4.1\\'s (which neither I nor him really cared for and which recently broke).I tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z5500\\'s which I own and love) The bass especially sucks on their speakers.So... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so it had to be the FX6021\\'s which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they\\'re probably worth it. These speakers a very niceThe sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno though that sounds good too).Subwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It\\'s very deep rich and discrete. Doesn\\'t shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complainyes I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass maybe you shouldn\\'t have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective but those reviews just don\\'t sound right to me.PROs* Tall sleek and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.* Power button on control pod* This is important NO BUZZING. Not while they\\'re on not while they off. 100% silent.CONs* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\" these notches aren\\'t always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.* Remote is a bit useless* While they look good and perform well they feel a little cheap* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand long cables are a PRO as well)And finally don\\'t be fooled by specs. Yes other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification but that really doesn\\'t matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn\\'t pay any attention to the specs I bought them because they sound the best ',\n",

The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home end page up page down and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven't gotten used to but it's fine.I have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I've experienced no problems here it's spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem really is it takes a while to register if you haven't use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however there are no problems at all.I do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had builtin bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don't use the mouse very much but the times I do use it I experience no problems.Both the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice.

       " 'This is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don\\'t think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.On the bright side however the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I\\'ve ever used the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB\\'s ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\") drum n\\' bass and many types of rap/hiphop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall opinions will vary. With rock music for example the strong bass is certainly a plus but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly and some detail is lost.It should be noted that this bassdominated sound signature renders the EB\\'s a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. In terms of build the EB\\'s superficially seem wellconstructed and designed. I have heard complaints however that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there Thoughtfully EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM\\'s (including foam flanged and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB\\'s don\\'t extend deeply into the ear canal which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal comfort is good and isolation decent. However if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB\\'s.Oh and some people think that the EB\\'s look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higherpriced Super fi 5 Pro model the EB\\'s stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.Like all of the UE IEM\\'s in this series the EB\\'s are packaged with a nice set of accessories including a 1/4\" adapter plug a sound attenuator a soft travel case an earwax loop and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM\\'s cord tangling.It\\'s unlikely that the EB\\'s will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bassdominant types of music. The truth is however that even for bassheavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bassy music the EB\\'s are welldesigned and definitely fun ',\n",

       " \"This is the 2nd Gamepad I've owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4button + DPad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted etc.I love this controller.  I've had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I've only used it in NFS games (I have them all).The WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.The rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFSMW is very slight but that's not the controllers fault it's a matter of programming by EA Games.I like the weight of the controller.  It's not feather light so with that motor and battery weight added it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it  canadian dollars).  I didn't like how my gravis gamepad as so light so this is a step up.The analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for nonslip action.  I am used to the DPad so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don't have time during a race to press a button before switching.It works as well as my old gamepad but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA you'll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.CONSIt's not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.CONCLUSIONI'm very satisfied overall and I knew I may have to get used to the way it feels when I hold this controller since changing from the old SNES style Gravis Gamepad.4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold \",\n",

       " \"I work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words I don't talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don't use speaker phone features. Let's just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn't care less about.This phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and backlit buttons all look very slick.The screen is attractive. A big step up from backlit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.I like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute adjust volume and page through your caller history.The belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.I know many 5.8 GHz phones don't mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don't know for sure if this phone falls into that category but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing's for sure this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.One other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it's nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.Finally I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use sitting it is dock the phone's screen displays the time.So far I've found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I've owned \",\n",

The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. I also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack.

I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. People are talking about this unit not having a radio on it but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way I already have all the songs I like at my fingertipsI think these headphones really make this nano great I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play For something so tiny it rocks I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso.

       " 'The 6500B was the last one I tried of three.  I\\'ve had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a twoline phone that wasn\\'t 2.4Ghz.The first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no builtin ans mach)  which is fine  but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stuttertone so didn\\'t know there were any new messages  arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. Next I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It\\'s a 2line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it\\'s simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But it\\'s answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn\\'t have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such  all good.  But if I got home say and listened to a message for my wife the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We\\'re so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it\\'s not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an autolineselection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a nonbusy outgoing line.  But that would have messed up their simpler style button function  hmmm.The Panasonic I am surprised to say ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic\\'s phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily this phone sets its date/time from callerid info even though the manual implies it wouldn\\'t work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busyforward) it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what  just pick up and talk.The 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It\\'s much lighter than earlier callerid handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets  I would like 6 or 7.  Also can\\'t name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number ',\n",

Don't underestimate this if you use the net at a library or cafe then you'll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you've got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don't have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems even win98. The sound quality is good I can't tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use onehanded.An unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks If you turn off the player it starts back up exactly where you left it be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter Its small without being too tiny its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won't have a heartattack. Its doesn't hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature but if you need to carry more than an album or 2 or need extra features then you'll want more than this player anyway. The best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3's and wma. It won't play AAC but if most of your music is this format you'll better off with an ipod.This would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles.

The SanDisk SDSDB128A10 Secure Digital 128MB like most 128MB cards will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.I truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs ',\n",

It is only good in the United States (including Washington DC but MINUS MAINE) but it does not include Guam Virgin Islands etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C. this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is if the manu. warranty is still good you have to use it.4. If the item needs to be shipped shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I\\'m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect and a upon the time of a 4th repair as determined by them they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\\'s warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn\\'t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you  many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans (such as they don\\'t cover accidents and they don\\'t cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things).

It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn't weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand if you can to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly then that is it game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn't fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB However there is one last thing to say. If you don't like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn't a fault with the mouse it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers. \",\n",

The armband would be more appropriate.NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\" so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit  Regardless there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners\\' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.All in all I am very happy with the lanyard.

       " \"Having been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.Each time buying a Sennheiser product I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD600's I had just come away from years owning the HD25. When these encountered a technical problem I replaced them with a backup choice the HD25SP's. The difference in sound going 'lower' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. Whether you use Sennheiser's merely for pleasure or for studio work the accuracy of their sound and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD600's ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt) and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD600's give you a clear idea of how things were recorded how good your system is and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.The reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70's all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called ''Economy Class Beatles'' George Harrison's and Ringo Starr's albums from the same decade) is down to what HD600's reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl because Compact Discs and DVD's still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more 'round' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums HD600's make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD600's are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to ''Take IT Away'' from 1982's Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to 'silence' a track that had a recording on it before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. It gets much worse than 'Take It Away' on Paul McCartney albums and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG RAM DOUBLE FANTASY MILK AND HONEY and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN and WALLS AND BRIDGES. 9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording it's just too bad the rest of the album doesn't sound as good as that one song.When you listen to your CD's vinyl DVD's in whatever room of your house your speakers are the room dictates what you hear no matter what you've spent on speakers power amps woofers subdividers etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting high ceilings low ceilings plaster or cement wood floors a more long than wide room it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard how they were recorded and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers McCartney's JET sounds quite full though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD600's the drums nearly become nonexistent and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. Can I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I'm trying to prove a point doesn't it.Albums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD600's. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70's and 80's when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs that are all HD600 friendlyIsao Tomita's The Firebird (1976)George Harrison's eponymous album (1979)Steely Dan's Gaucho (1980)Joe Walsh's The Smoker You Drink The Player You Get (1973)10CC's The Original Soundtrack (1975)Godley &amp Creme's Consequences (1977)Supertramp's Crime of the Century (1974)XTC's Black Sea (1980)Peter Gabriel's 3rd album (1980)Kate Bush's The Dreaming (1982)Earth Wind and Fire's All 'n' All (1977)Level 42's The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)Billy Cobham's Spectrum (1972)Frank Zappa's One Size Fits All (1975)Ringo Starr's Goodnight Vienna (1974)and a truly incredible sounding album from the 90's Prince and The New Power Generation's ''Symbol'' album from 1992.Albums NOT HD600 friendlyTodd Rundgren's Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)Blue Oyster Cult's Agents of Fortune (1976)Paul McCartney's Venus and Mars (1975  and quite a few others)John Lennon's Imagine (1971  and avoid 1970's Instant Karma like the plague the piano track will hurt you . .  )Yes's Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)and surprisingly enough many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain't broken.  If you have to save up for a pair or do some heavy searching for HD600's that are affordable do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed especially when I kept up with their pace. \",\n",

The help quite clearly states \"You cannot convert a file into an MP3 file\". It will convert to .wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to MP3.If it had MP3 support (at least conversion on the PC from the Sony proprietary format which is .msv) I would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible. It you record in full quality mode (1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing. The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.But it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion. Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space.But I would buy one again as it is very easy to use small and very high quality. I just hope Sony would listen to consumers and support MP3 ',\n",

       " 'Before I bought this device I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was I didn\\'t like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.It was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer I simply unplug the USB.  It\\'s very simple.I am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn\\'t fancy) this does not cause diminished sound quality so I\\'m perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.If you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo check for two things.  First your stereo has to have a set of two holes sidebyside that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I\\'m sorry I do not know the technical names for these things but there\\'s a picture of the redandwhite plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer\\'s \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside be sure to check your player for these two things.Overall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product ',\n",

       " \"I bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works it works beautifully. When it doesn't work it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic you have to swap the batteries.

What a fabulous piece of audio equipmentWhen we began searching for a replacement for our Infiniti surround system my husband and I had different concerns.  He is an audiophile that demands wide range digital sound with full depth of field and I was ready for aestethic simplicity (no speakers throughout the room and wires everywhere).  When we found the YSP1 we thought it was too good to be true.  One speaker instead of five?  Wallmounted?  Doesn't take up any floor space?  We visited two Yamaha dealers to see it for ourselves.  One had the YSP1 set up in a room environment.  The other on the salesroom floor.  In both setups it performed consistantly.  In both demonstrations however my husband felt the lowend sound could use enhancement.  So we made the purchase and opted to use the YSP1 with our existing subwoofer.  Installation was fairly simple provided you have the necessary tools.  The most important and timeconsuming part was leveling and centering the speaker under the television.  Now that it is installed and in use in our home I feel the lowend sound is quite adequate and prefer not to use the subwoofer.  My husband though prefers the earthshaking action sequences in movies to mimic their intended theatre quality sound.  More than movies the sound quality you get when listening to CDs is absolutely stunning.  Overall we both got what we wanted.

       " 'Once THE speaker of choice for every hard rockin\\' audiophile with a big enough garage Klipsch fell off the landscape for a while after being sold to a corporate conglomerate that didn\\'t know the real value of what they\\'d bought.  But after another buyout by a small group of genuine audiophiles Klipsch is back on top from a sound quality standpoint  and it shows in the ProMedia 2.1 THX.I have my trio connected to a new Mac Pro desktop unit and the sound is absolutely magical.  Yes there are more complex setups with 5 or 7 speakers spread out across the room but if you just want the magic without the madness the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 THX is an incredible (and very affordable) solution that\\'s quick and easy to configure in about 5 minutes.Of course there are other 3speaker desktop systems by makers like Logitech Cyber Acoustics and Intec but here\\'s the difference Klipsch is a true speaker company that connects great speakers to your computer while those others are computer peripherals companies that one day decided to make speakers.  NOT the same thing.  The only brands that are true competitors to Klipsch in this area are Bose Harman Kardon JBL and Altec Lansing.  I find that the Altec Lansing and JBL 3speaker sets both sound nasal and \"tinny\" on the high end while the Bose and Harman Kardon sets sound great but are more expensive.  So after a good look (and listen) around I went with Klipsch.In any case this is an incredible sound setup for your computerbased music player and should not be overlooked.  Enjoy ',\n",

Several times my Ipod came off the suction cups and being on a plane with minimal room and people sitting next to me trying to get my ipod off the floor is not fun. Overall I recommend this product.

As stated in others' reviews you can't read the screen from a distance thus rendering the ability to scroll through the menu with the remote a bit pointless.  However it would be worse if the remote couldn't scroll through menus.It is compatible with the latest video iPod.  I have the 60 gig iPod but I do notice a slight hiss coming out from the speakers.  I listen to classical music and the hiss bothers me.  I bought this for my wife and she is not as picky as I am in terms of sound quality.  Then again I don't expect high fidelity quality from this small setup.  Since I have this little gadget for my wife I bought the Squeezebox for myself from Slim Devices to stream music which sounds a lot better.In summary this dock does a good job and the design is not bad.  The construction is solid and I like the light on the remote.  If you are looking for great sound quality I haven't encountered any dock that is better than this one so this might be your best bet.  The Apple A/V cables work fine as well but it is more expensive than the dock and I see more value in this dock \",\n",

Until a few hours ago I was running two 20\" aluminum cinema displays on a PNY 6600GT.  After doing online research about using the 30\" display under Windows XP I found that the \"functional\" cheap solution being used is in fact the PNY 6600GT (Verto 128MB DDR3 with two DVI connectors).  Considering that the other two most noted solutions QuadroFX 4000 AGP or Parhelia DL256 PCI are going for $600+ on ebay I was willing to give my old beater a try.  Besides I didn\\'t feel like buying another AGP card with PCIE taking over the world or sacrificing the only PCI slot in my Shuttle XPC (SB75G2).To my great relief the monitor worked on the card right away even showing me the POST and Windows startup screen (it did for the 20\" displays too).  But to my absolute delight the card is actually running both the 30\" and a 20\" in 32bit color.  The 20\" looks absurdly small next to the 30\" like I didn\\'t water it enough or something.  The 30\" is enormous enough that I think it might be better were it curved  Maybe I\\'m just sitting too close.The only problem with the 6600GT is that the DVI jacks are so near each other that I had to take the plastic housing off of the 20\" plug to fit it below the 30\".  I\\'m not a gamer so I can\\'t say whether the card performs well for that.  It feels as zippy as with the 20\" on regular windowing tasks.  I use Eclipse Flash Photoshop etc. but no video editing or 3D stuff.The screen had a slight warm cast that I didn\\'t like.  Nvidia\\'s control panel let me adjust it manually and now my 30\" and 20\" look almost identical.  My biggest fear was of course dead pixels.  By the good grace of lucky ducks this is the third panel I\\'ve gotten from Apple with no dead pixels.  Brightness is uniform but for a very very subtle drop in the far lower left and right edges.  It\\'s not apparent unless you put white there and actively look for it.In any case I bought it to get more programming panels on the screen at once and it does a fine job at that.  I\\'m using the 20\" for browsing and alas a few panels that STILL don\\'t fit.  Apple where\\'s 3840 x 2400??  I strip one star cuz it\\'s crazy expensive. ',\n",

At home I use a Wacom tablet.  Next month I am traveling abroad so I wanted a slightly bigger mouse that can handle more frequent use than the Kensington.  Wireless was key for portability.  I also wanted something rechargeable and I didn't want the USB adapter sticking out.I received it today and I'm on my first charge.  So no comments on batteries (which can be replaced with other AAA NiMH for optimal performance if desired anyway). I have large but skinny hands.  Mouse is small but its long length helps in terms of where to place your fingers.  Of course convenience is not comparable to a fullsize mouse but if you want portability this is about the right size. I have a PowerBook that runs Tiger (10.4).  Excellent Bluetooth connection.  Also very good response very little delay.  Only reservation is for the scroll wheel which requires subtle pressure for accurate scrolling  this is ever so slightly uncomfortable if you have large hands because the mouse is flat and your hand is adjusted over the mouse so that it is a bit hard to apply adequate vertical pressure on the scroll wheel from that position.  It is hard to explain but not a big issue for me.  USB charger works well.  The added size of the USB adapter helps with comfortability (still flat but becomes an otherwise fullsized mouse)  despite the fact that the cable attaches to the bottom of the mouse. As mentioned by others installing the batteries is a challenge.  Pull the notch on the bottom of the mouse as you slide the top (part with the Anycom label) away from the clickers.  Once I figured it out not so hard. Overall I don't seek perfection anyway so this mouse does the job adequately for me.  I haven't tried any other Bluetooth mouse before so I'm more or less in awe \",\n",

       " 'I have to admit I\\'m a GPS junkie.  I\\'ve had a variety of GPS units over the past decade and currently own 3  the c340 being my latest acquisition for use solely when driving.I am greatly impressed with this unit.  It was fast to get going right out of the box and after the initial satellite acquisition and almanac download (for those who are interested when a GPS unit is turned off and moved a significant distance say 300+ miles from where it last thought it was it needs to recalibrate itself by downloading the current almanac of satellite positions from the GPS satellites.  This can take a few minutes.) In any case after the initial automatic recalibration the unit acquired satellites quickly whenever I turned it on.The user interface is very easy to use.  I\\'ve used Hertz NeverLost systems for years and have always thought they had a good interface.  I think Garmin\\'s is better.One highly useful feature is the ability not just to search for Points of Interest (POI) but to have the unit search for those points of interest that are along the route you are currently navigating.  This allows you to identify say hotels along your route while you are driving and then using the telephone info provided by the unit to call the hotels up and see if you can negotiate a lower rate before you arrive  \"let your fingers do the walking...\"If you don\\'t tell the unit where to look though it can take quite a while to search for a Point of Interest.  I didn\\'t know which city to specify and I did a search for \"Eagle Rock Rec\" (I was too lazy to spell out \"Eagle Rock Recreation Center\" which turned out to be about 175 miles away) and the unit chugged away for several minutes but eventually came back with the right entry for me to navigate to.  I later realized that even though I didn\\'t know the exact city the destination was in I did know a city that was near the desired destination.  When I specified that information the c340 took only a few seconds to find the right location.The advanced user can also create your own POI lists complete with custom icons and load those into the c340.  I have done this for all InNOut Burger and Krispy Kreme locations.  The advantage to having your own custom POIs even though these places are in the builtin POI list is that the custom POIs are visible on the c340 map screen at certain zoom levels.  If you are a Geocacher you can do the same with geocaches but you\\'ll still need your handheld unit to find the cache.The newer (and more expensive) c5xx units evidently have the Sirf circuitry in them which is more sensitive allowing signal acquisition indoors but I found the sensitivity of the c340 to be fine  especially since I have limited my indoor driving lately ). I haven\\'t tried the c340 under a thick tree canopy with cloud cover yet so I might change my tune.  The comparable c5xx unit at this price point the c530 lacks the c340\\'s texttospeech capabilities (this prevents the c530 from announcing street names).Since I already have a Garmin handheld GPS unit as well as Garmin\\'s MapSource Topo mapping software I used the unlock code that came with the c340 to unlock my MapSource maps for the unit. I then loaded the topo maps for the entire Western US onto an SD card (between 300500 MB) and plugged it into the c340 to see what would happen.  It worked  So now I have the c340\\'s excellent builtin maps and POIs for onroad trips *and* Topo Maps available to me for offroad adventures.One thing you should do if you are in the US is enable the unit\\'s WAAS capability (the default is for WAAS to be disabled).  Enabling this capability increases the accuracy of the unit when certain satellites are in range.Also since this unit has a touchscreen fingerprints on the screen are inevitable. You should *never* use an ammoniabased product (like most window cleaners) to clean electronic screens  it will cause them to fog.  Instead use those little antiseptic alcohol towelettes.  They are cheap and if you don\\'t use them for cleaning your touchscreen they might come in handy for firstaid.I give this unit a highly positive rating.  I like it ',\n",

I\\'ve been running this Sony DVPNS90V player through a Sony widescreen HDTV and a Pioneer amplifier/receiver for several days now and I find almost none of the problems and limitations mentioned by previous reviewers. One for example states that there is \"no bass management\" yet you can (a) route more or less signal to the subwoofer by selecting \"small\" or \"large\" for the front speaker size (see page 76 of the user\\'s manual) and also (b) increase or decrease the bass from 15 dB to +5 dB (see page 77 of the manual). Whether you prefer analog to digital audio or you think SACD\\'s are tops is a matter of opinion taste and choice and not an objective evaluation of a playback unit. I for one prefer DVDAudio and I mention this for an important reason Some product ads and the user\\'s manual clearly warn that this unit \"will NOT play DVDAudio discs.\" Happy surprize it most certainly will For my DVDA\\'s that have optional Dolby 5.1 and/or DTS tracks the player simply ignores the primary DVDA format (normally output via the 6 analog cable connectors) but still plays the Dolby or the DTS via the digital audio (optical or coaxial) connectors. For \"pure\" DVDA\\'s (without Dolby 5.1 or DTS tracks) it conveniently outputs the audio BOTH via the 6 analog AND the digital connectors. And in all cases above the audio is full multichannel surround and not downmixed to 2channel PCM nor Prologic pseudosurround. The only DVDA function it lacks is the video slideshow often included on DVDA\\'s and so displays only the \"jacket image\" onscreen. The Quick Setup allows any DVD newbie to be up and running in a short time. And the Custom Setup is so detailed with so many fine tweaks and troubleshooters that it\\'s bound to please even the highend audiovideo geekfreaks. In short you\\'ll find this to be a superior universal player provided you read the user\\'s manual (all 84 pages of it) follow it and connect equally highquality compatible equipment capable of exploiting its many fine features ',\n",

       " \"I've had my Epson 1280 for over two years now and consider it money well spent. I run exclusively on Linux (currently Gentoo) and the Linux support for this printer (using CUPS) is superb. All modes resolutions etc. are supported. I use this printer a lot for engineering work printing Bsize (tabloid) drawings and it works great for that.Like just about every review states this printer slurps ink like Homer Simpson slurps beer. Because I don't print many color photos this is not a problem for meif I was doing that I'd get the Niagara system other reviewers cite. I've researched the Niagara system and  it looks like a good deal for heavy users. My main complaint with this printerand the reason why it only gets four starsis the ease with which the heads clog up. This printer wants to be used constantly. If you let it sit for a day or two it's almost guaranteed that one or more of the jets will clog up and you'll get streaks in the output. Then you have to either press the frontpanel control or in more extreme cases run the headunclogging utility (on Linux I use mtink) to force the printer to 'blow out' the plugged jets. When the printer does this it blasts ink through the heads wasting even more of the pricey ink. Do this enough and the reservoir the printer blasts the ink into (a spongesandpaperlike thing) will overflow and cause the head to smear ink all over the paper. That's when you get out the Windex and paper towels and clean up the mess (google the web for details.) Because of this 'trait' I would not recommend this printer for casual users.Still for Bsized printing and highquality photos and considering how well supported it is under Linux there's not much else better out there \",\n",
       " \"Having owned a 1280 for a year and a half thus far I can say that this printer is for somone who wants a reliable and problem free large format printer that produces on target results. The drivers at least for Mac OS X are easy to understand and reliable. The ability to manage the printer such as doing a nozzle check and a head clean right from the application that is going to be printing is a vey nice touch as well. However it is the colors that this printer gets high reviews from me. By using mat or glossy photo paper and making the proper print settings one can get nice rich colors that are on cue. Thus this printer makes good for doing proofs. As an artist and Graphic Designer having this quality is a blessing since this print cost $ 400 at the time of parchase. Compare that to profesional quality workhorses going from $2000 on up. Also being able to print up to 13 x 19 save me loads of time since that cuts down on the number of trips to my local print service to have them do my print outs on there large format printers. The only minuses are that one needs a generous amout of desktop realestate to acomadate the 1280 as it is almost twice the size of a normal 8 1/2 x 11 printer. Also one needs be prepared to shell out some payolla as the ink cartriges can get pricey. But what inkjet dosen't have that problem? Anyway that little expences is nullified by savings of not having to go to my print service so often. So any one looking for a good large format printer that produces some good printouts and not have to pay an arm and a leg for it the 1280 is a very good cadadate for that job. So I'm giving 5 stars on the Epson 128 \",\n",

I have had a few days to use it and compare it to my other players mainly my Philips 642 which have been excellent players for me. This Model does well.  I don\\'t understand why this model has such a rough reveiw.  Note this model has the DVI output If your TV has an HDMI port you will want to check out the Samsung HD 850 (identical otherwise).  First this model has component composite and Svideo hook ups as well as the DVI port (still have to run seperate sound out with DVI). Also this model does feature digital coax sound out and optical sound out as well for systems that can handle 5.1 THX.  Many upconvert models do not have the digital outs on lower priced models. The picture quality is great at 480p comparable with my Philips.  Again The upconvert works well out the DVI hook up to my TV but to be honest it is hard to tell any difference between it and a good 480p progressive scan player at least on my tv which is a 23\" 720p LCD.  Menus also are a bit difficult to figure out at first as well.  The user manual is less than impressive at explaining thing in fact it does not have an index.  But it the main thing is that the player is does perform well and is a name brand product from samsung (I have had some offbrand experience and have had perfomace problems).  THis player also appears to have DivX available on it not noted in the product discription so that was a suprise as well.  This will allow the use of MP4 movie files.  The remote again is bigger and at first more difficult than my other players but after a day or so it actually is better because many of the features are available to change at the push of a button instread of going through the menus.  In all I will continue to explore this new player but in all it seems to be a quality product that has received some bad flack.  So give it a chane the prices are good currently quality has been good and it is a Samsung.Note to the technosavy I have not had luck using the component upconvert code that is available on other web sites so I am using my DVI input for upconvert.  Also the new Blue ray (HD 1080p) DVD players are out so if you have the expensive hi res tvs that can handle this you might want to wait and save till you can get the new DVD players.

This dock was included on the original iPod Photo of late 2004 (priced $500$600) the dock was removed as Apple lowered the prices this year to their current levels for color iPods.  However for a couple of uses high quality home audio and Slide Shows on hires TVs it is a great alternative.This dock basically serves three purposes The traditional synch &amp charge function available since the early days.

It is the best way to connect your iPod to a home stereo or home theater. The super Video out for color iPods.  This function is something you cannot get without the dock.

I'll try to describe some aspects that aren't mentioned in the other reviews. The owner's manual can also be found online in PDF format.It can schedule upto 16 programs. It does not support VCR+ or a TViOstyle program guides. You can enter a title into each schedule that appears both on the schedule list and direct navigator chapter menus. It even sorts the main schedule listing and indicates which events are on the current disk. Every onscreen menu shows you which remote control buttons are functional on that screen.The commercial skip button advances about 60 seconds which isn't quite granular enough but 2 clicks and a little fast forwarding works well. The remote operations have a very fast feeling response compared to tape players. My only complaint The remote sensor on the recorder seems to be all the way on righthand side. When the unit is in our video cabinet the sensor is in a deadzone for half the room. We can't shift the position much because the disk tray slot is all the way on the left side and won't open if it's too close to the wall. Of course this probably means nothing to you.At the highest quality setting (XP) it made a very good (near perfect I'd say) copy from a 8mm video camera using analog inputs. At that setting only one hour of content fits on a DVD. The next lower setting (SP) which can hold two hours per disk the copy from the video camera had some contrast problems. Most TV shows recorded in EP (8 hrs) are acceptable quality although you do see the blockiness and some motion blur at times. This is especially pronounced on animated shows. The fourhour LP setting had no apparent digital artifacts on recorded TV. It also has a Flexmode option I haven't tried yet in which you tell it how long to record and it will fit the recording to the freespace available on the disk at the highest possible quality.  Probably would be good for recording a TV movie.It's too bad other vendors haven't adopted the RAM format because most of the features on this box only work on that kind of media but it won't play on most other equipment. The other formats seem lame by comparison but this unit can play and record on them. Watching one show while another is recording (or the same show that's recording but from the beginning) is very easy to do. Most of the operations are very sensible and explained onscreen pretty well but you should spend some time in the manual if you've never had a dvd recorder before. It can do a lot of stuff.One interesting feature is that no matter what input you are using the signal is sent through the svideo output.It can't burn music CD's which seems like it would have been a trivially easy feature to add. That and a battery backup (so I won't lose my schedule) and wider angle of view for the remote sensor would required get the fifth review star \",\n",

Sling has instructions on their web site but I still had to mess around with my settings in order to get it to work. To work on multiple routers you have to do port forwarding on both routers to port 5001. Once I worked this out everything is great. Video quality is good in the house haven't tried it from another location. I'm running the Sling AV with Netgear Ethernet power adaptors to my router and then watching TV via wireless to my laptop. Now we can watch TV in any room of the house. My wife loves being able to watch the news in the morning while in the kitchen. She also loves being able to surf while having a show running in a small window on the side. Control of my Dish DVR is very good. We can manage any feature of our Satelite/DVR box. This will come in handy when we travel as we have our sons Seaseme Street shows on the DVR and now we can take those with us on the road. Overall I'm pleased with the Sling AV. It offers good performance at a great price point. Now Sling just needs to get the Mac version out so I can watch TV on my beautiful 15.4 inch Mac Book Pro \",\n",

It does have trouble getting a signal downtown sometimes when I am surrounded by tall buildings (Wacker Dr.)  But this is expected and can be corrected with the purchase of an external antenna.Overall this GPS works perfectly.

       " 'Soundwise the Klipsch Promedia Ultra 5.1s were everything that they were supposed to be.  The bass is very powerful and can even be overpowering if not adjusted.  The sound is crystal clear and with a decent sound card all of the settings can be tweaked until perfection.  Setup was a breeze and no instructions are needed although they are provided just in case.Something to note is the speaker wire that comes with the speakers is a little on the small size and thicker wires should be be purchased if you are picky about your sound.  The wires themselves are long enough and there shouldn\\'t be any trouble reaching anywhere assuming you are putting these in a normal sized room.  One last thing to know is that there is no optical input for these speakers and only 1/8\" plugs for hooking up the sound source.  If you want optical you\\'re going to have to go elsewhere.Please note that buying these speakers will not make up for having a mediocre sound card or poor music quality.  If you are using most types of on board sound or an ancient soundblaster card it is time to upgrade or else you are just throwing away your money.  Same goes for music quality if you are listening to an mp3 that is below 128kbps the poor sound quality is because of the shoddy encoding not the speakers.  If you can\\'t spare the hard drive space for 192kbps its time to get a new hard drive.Overall these speakers are a great deal.  While the price tag does seem a bit steep it is well worth the money for anyone that is serious about their music or movies.  For those of you who like to game these speakers will treat you good however in my past experience a good set of headphones is better than a full blown sound system.  Lastly for those of you who like to play your music and bass full blast don\\'t bother spending the money.  These speakers should only be purchased by people who actually care about sound quality.  If you are more worried about loudness do yourself a favor and buy some cheaper speakers you won\\'t even notice the difference ',\n",

       " 'I hadn\\'t seen this product in stores as I usually would see the white TuneDok which seemed pretty cool but I decided to buy this one online to go better with my black car (I have a white 40GB 4th generation iPod).The holder is everything you would expect and it did work a little better than I expected. It\\'s very easy to just place the iPod in the holder and very easy to take it off. You can do it with one hand. You just pull back the small tab of the suction thing on the back and your iPod is easily removed and ready to go. The additional cup adapters is an added bonus for those who need them but the standard one was enough for me.The part that is black and holds the iPod is what seems to be the best thing about the product. As far as I know the cups are the same grey color for both the white TuneCok and this black version so the difference is only in the iPod holder and not the cups.The only \"bad\" thing I could say is that the cup itself is made of a rubbery plastic that scratches easily. In fact when I was trying to figure out what the adapters were for (before reading the manual..oops) I scratched it quite a LOT trying to fit the two additional cups together. That doesn\\'t affect functionality so it doesn\\'t make me give it less than 5 stars. A small issue you might want to consider as well is that the TuneDok doesn\\'t hold iPods in their cases. So if you\\'re like me and carry your iPod everywhere in a case you might wan to consider having a case that is easy to put on the iPod and remove it to avoid the hassle everytime you want to place the iPod on the TuneDok.I like how the black TuneDok looks with my white iPod. It kind of makes the iPod stand out more than the TuneDok itself. I think the $15 price is pretty reasonable for the white TuneDok and this one is too if you\\'re willing to pay the extra $5 for it to go with your U2 iPod. But as I said I think my white iPod looks cooler in my black car with the black TuneDok anyway.Edit I bought it for $20 but now it\\'s $15. One more good reason to get this one.I\\'m not too sure but it seems like the new 5G iPod fits in the TuneDok. If they do I bet this product is going to turn into a top seller soon enough as the demand for the black iPods is greater than the white one. Maybe someone who gets their 5G iPod can confirm this so don\\'t buy this for your 5G iPod unless you\\'re already sure or can try it before you buy it ',\n",

The only problem I have encountered with any digital camera is that when you think you have enough memory you run out when you need it most. That is why I upgraded all of my cameras from 256 and 512 meg memory sticks to the Sony 1 gig. Actually I carry a spare 1 gig too where ever I go. Look when you take video with your digital camera or you use a high file size (36 megapixels) per picture which you should always do to get the best possible prints made your camera will need a ton of storage space.  Especially if you are on vacation or encounter a great photo moment or maybe even something you hadn\\'t expected like a wildfire a plane crash a bank robbery or maybe even a cat in the park having kittens. You can always \"resize\" you photos to a smaller size later when you save then to your computer if you want to save space.

       " \"I've used the iTrip by Belkin the TunecastII by Belkin and this Monster iCarPlay for getting my tunes to my car speakers.  This is the best design and works the best of the three.  I like that it can charge my iPod and that the transmitter itself is inline.  The signal seems to be decent enough though of course it crackles sometimes or you hear a bit of static.  This gets more pronounced the louder you make it.I think this is the safest for car use.  The iTrip is a nightmare because you have to change the station through the iPod.  So if you're taking a car trip (I live in NY but went to college in MI  that's a 12 hour drive) and signals are coming in and out and you need to adjust you really can't do it safely with the iTrip.  The Tunecast is a bit better but that runs on batteries (the optional charger/power supply that I got for it didn't work).  Also you can tune into any FM station with the up/down buttons which is good but you really only need the lower stations.  The iCarPlay has 8 frequencies it can transmit over and only 1 button.  Though I feel limited by the 8 I don't think going higher would help because there's more congestion.  I like the single button because there's no confusion whether you're going up or down and you can press the button then easily tune the radio up a notch.  The other limitation I see is its iPod specific (uses dock connector) whereas the Tunecast just hooks into the headphone jack and it only works in cigarette lighters so you can't use it without a car (or something else with that power source).  But considering I bought it to use in my car it does what it should and does a decent job of it \",\n",

       " 'Let me just preface this review by mentioning that I read many customer reviews(here and elsewhere) on this product before purchasing it. I focused on the negative reviews as to develop a good idea of any potential design flaws. After using this keyboard for almost 6 months I believe that Saitek delivers an attractive design with solid quality. Command Pad Many reviews bash this feature. It is quite a basic pad as compared to some but it gets the job done. My only main gripe with the pad was how it failed to deliver some windows macros such as ctrlaltdelete. During games such as WoW and CoD2 I had no problems whatsoever. The rumor about the horrible software and it being buggy was nonexistent for me. The customers who claimed it to be \"impossible\" and \"buggy\" seem to be computer illiterate at best and judging from the frequency of grammatical errors in their reviews possible English illiterate as well. If you are familiar with computer hardware then you will be fine with this software and pad.Keyboard The quietness response and overall feel of the keys rival any Logitech design. I am a huge fan/customer of Logitech equipment and thus can confidently state that this board is of equal material quality. Saitek took a more simple route with this design(no LCD screen etc...) and the price shows it.*I almost laughed out loud after recently reading some of the passionate and disgruntled reviews concerning the lack of keysymbol illumination. It is obvious that these reviewers did not know much about the product they purchased. Unfortunately failing to be informed about a product one buys totally demerits any kind of negative opinion resulting from that lack of knowledge. I would guess that 90% of the negative reviews about this board capitalize on this point resulting in a much lower overall rating than deserved. Last and probably least comes the aesthetics of course the most subjective part of any review. I found this setup to be very sharp looking. In the dark the vivid key definition from the backlights allows any experienced typist to quickly find whatever he/she is looking for. This eliminates the need for symbol illumination. Although symbol illumination might be a nice touch especially for the keyboard deficient I feel that Saitek sacrificed this option to provide very durable lettering. I have lost some lettering on Logitech keyboards sooner than the 6 months I\\'ve been using this one(Although frequency of gaming has fluctuated). Saitek Engineers probably figured that most gamers would know the keyboard well enough to not need both key definition and symbol illumination apparently an oversight on their part.

I've listened to a great deal of MP3 music through these babies and I am very impressed.  Spacial/stereo imaging is great and I've actually heard things in the songs that I have never heard before  It actually shows the imperfections of my MP3 and makes me realize that I probably need to turn up the bit rate when ripping my CDs.  The controls are also simple to use both on the cord and on the PC.Audio recording quality is great as well.  I have tried it with Dragon and recognition works great with it.  Playback of recorded sound shows that the sound is a little on the dark side however.  Ps and Bs are a little too hot even though I have tried different mike positions and used the included wind sock.My biggest problem with the set is in the comfort department.  I first feel obligated to tell you that I do not normally wear full coverage headphones.  Usually I wear highquality buds.  So perhaps I just have to get used to it.  However I feel as though my ears are being squeezed too much with these headphones.  Instead of feeling like they are comfortably secure they feel as though they are too tight and they make my ears hot... even after only 15 minutes.So despite my positive review of the sound quality I am going to send these back and try the PC165.  They supposedly have bigger ear cups which will hopefully translate to more comfort?  Other people here have not had problems with the comfort of the 155s so it is probably just me.UPDATE I received the PC165 set and there is a big difference.  The sound is fuller and bigger (not louder) on the 165s.  Also the comfort is much better.  They don't pinch my ears like the 155s.  The cord going to the headset is also thicker which means fewer tangles and less chance of damage.  If you're thinking of the 155s I would get the 165s instead \",\n",

I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires I wish that the headset was more sold.  On the otherhand I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now.  And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller which is important to me especially as my hearing starts to deminish.  I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone.  IMO this is too complementary.

       " 'I\\'ve gone through a ton of headphones in recent years. They\\'ve included Koss \"The Plug\" Sennheiser PX100 Koss UR29 Koss SportaPro and a few others. All had their strong and weak points. So far this has been the closest I\\'ve had to a good balance.For my tastes (not necessarily anybody else\\'s) strong bass is one of the most important things. The PX100 felt very weak in this area despite what everybody else seemed to say  weaker than my old Sony MDRNC20 (which are still going strong after 6 years and remain my backup headphone of choice thanks to their decent sound and folding ability). I had problems keeping \"The Plug\" sealed in my ears despite the \"hold the outer ear while the Plug seats\" advice. They\\'re also a very a bad choice for iPods because their very low impedance overdrives the amplifier circuit. The SportaPros had great bass but leaked way too much sound. The UR29 had good bass and very good isolation but were a little uncomfortable warm heavy and too bulky to use on the go. Going back a few years I had a pair of AKG K240s that had disappointing bass. Ditto for a pair of Sennheiser HD420s.The K26P seems to combine the better aspects of all these phones. The bass is among the strongest. When I listen to the 1812 Overture the \"cannon blasts\" come through loud and clear even at moderately low volumes with no distortion at all. Isolation isn\\'t as good as the UR29 but not too bad. Certainly a lot more portable easy to stow in my bag at all times. The PX100s fold smaller but they\\'re a pain in the neck to stow in their hard case. The higher efficiency of the K26P means I can set my iPod at a lower volume. Instead of 5560% of max volume with the UR29 or the stock earbuds I now run at 3540% comfortably. In terms of comfort they\\'re comfortable enough for hours of wearing after a couple of slight modifications. If they press too hard on your hears first extend the headband all the way then GENTLY straighten each half a little bit by gripping a couple of inches of steel band at a time and unbending it. After a few tries it should be perfectly fitted to your head. Don\\'t bend too hard or grip the plastic parts or you can break the phones. Be patient. So it takes a couple of days of trial and error but in the end you get goodsounding phones that are wonderfully comfortable. You\\'d be surprised how little pressure is needed to produce a good seal. You\\'ll know if you\\'ve unbent too far because either the phones will slide down or you lose bass. Here\\'s an easy test with a finger on each side press the earcups harder onto your ears. If the bass doesn\\'t get stronger as you press (the way it does with all openair headphones) that\\'s as good a seal as you need. I hated the little square foam pads on the plastic sliders and quickly peeled them off. All they seem to do is create two pressure points on top of the head. Other phones with similar headbands (like the Koss SportaPro/PortaPro) don\\'t use these pads so I don\\'t think they\\'re really necessary. Better to let the headband rest directly on the scalp and distribute the pressure over the entire headband and so far my suspicions seem to have been correct. It has been far more comfortable for me without the pads especially after more than half an hour. In fact without the pads I barely feel the headband at all.Overall I\\'m satisified especially at its low price point. I hope to use these for many years to come until either they break or something better comes along. By the way don\\'t be put off by comments about the warranty being invalid in the US and Canada.

However the SRF59 perhaps because of its analog tuning suffers less from cochannel and adjacent channel interference on FM.  It\\'s audio is slightly brighter and more musical with a decent pair of headphones or earbuds than its digitally tuned cousin.  With this in mind I purchased another SRF59 yesterday and spent all last evening listening to it.  I literally could not make myself shut it off and go to bed I was having so much fun scanning the FM dial.  There was a program which aired last night on a local channel which featured bassheavy 12\" remixes of eighties new wave hits with blessfully very limited commercial interruption.  Over the course of a three hour listening session I gradually cranked up the volume.  As I was too lazy to fish out decent earbuds it became apparent that with bassheavy audio at very loud volumes the SRF59\\'s tiny amplifier was insufficient to drive stock Walkman style headphones and peak audio was clipped which simply necessitated turning the volume down a tad to restore full musicality (I understand that decent quality earbuds require less power to achieve the same level of high sound output therefore there will be no audio clipping).  Nevertheless the sound quality from this bargainpriced Walkman through less than ordinary headphones was astounding.  The party is literally in your head and the soundstage ranges from ear to ear which is somewhat disconcerting when it is located above your sinuses.  I also made one pass through the AM band and there the SRF59 was no slouch either.  I hauled in 1200 WOAI San Antonio which is approximately 1000 miles from me.  Though no true DX machine after all how could it be it is at the least a competent performer on the AM band as well (I suspect early in the evening AM DXing conditions were as good as they have been in a long time).

But here are my 2 centsI got these to replace some aging Sony MDRV2's that I purchased maybe 10 years ago.  The ear cushions of the MDRV2's had begun to deteriorate and I figured it was time to see what had improved in 10 years.  I just compared them to the older V2s and I can say that the V6 is definitely better.  They fully surround the ears (V2s just sat on your ear pressing on them).  The V6s also seem to offer more detailed sound.  I concur that they sound a little bright but I can take care of this on my iPod by setting the EQ to ReduceTreble (but I like the brightness so sometimes I don't do that).  I do NOT concur with other review comments about weak bass.  They appear to have the right amount.  (IMHO  it is a shame that bass has been overemphasized in the past decade at the expense of flatness and noncoloring of sound).  I also concur that the sensitivity of these is quite good (plenty loud for me with the iPod  and I listen at good levels  albeit not ear damaging ones).As a last comment I notice Amazon has these for about $65.  I paid $99 at a local store.  Buy from Amazon   (no  I don't work for or invest in them  \",\n",

By the way I've owned the Sony MDRV600's for a couple of years now thinking they had replaced these but they are actually more of a consumer model that seem to be comparable in terms of price and specifications but are actually quite inferior to these in my opinion.

The Good They are not only noisecancelling but they also are rubber earbuds which fit snugly and comfortably in the ear blocking more noise. If you put them on without any audio source in only dulls background noise but I think that\\'s the best you can expect from any pair. While listening to audio nearly everything is blocked out unless you really listen for it. There is a neck strap with the noisecancelling component in the middle and the two earbuds hanging from each side. You put it around your neck like a necklace put the buds in your ears and use the power and volume controls on the noisecancelling piece.The Bad Nothing is actually \"bad\" about them but they\\'re not quite perfect. The earbuds will easily slip out if you\\'re sweating or if they get at all greasy from your skin or earwax. However they pop right off and you can wash them with a little soap and water in about 10 seconds. I do this daily when I use them. However that doesn\\'t make them the best solution for walking or jogging. Once one starts slipping it generally won\\'t stay in well until it (and your ears) have been cleaned which detracts from the noisecancelling effect. Other Thoughts The cord is plenty long enough to reach an iPod or whatever at about belt level. However if the player is in a pants pocket it could be a little close. Also I often wear it when I\\'m not using it because you can forget it\\'s there and also it beats putting it into a pocket to get tangled. I had an issue once because I was sitting at a desk and it dangled to the floor. When I stood up I stood on the end and the force of my neck going up while my foot held it down damaged the wiring  I began to get a slight buzz in one ear. However I blame myself for that  it was a mighty tug.I bought mine at Target where they were labelled $24.99 on \"clearance\" from $49.99. A couple of months later they were back to $49.99. Once they dropped again to $34.99 (another \"clearance\" price) I bought a second pair as a backup. I\\'m glad I did  I\\'m still using the second pair. Battery life is great.

If these came with a woofer unit these would be ideal speakers as the 2pieces alone do not produce any significant bass at all. Just the \"hints\" of bass in the music but no thud if that\\'s what you are hoping for. I did turn these up loud to listen to their full sound and they do sound good.  These are perfect for offices and just daily music sound is superb. Not for audiophiles or for people who are expecting to shake everything on their desks. Build quality is \"ok\". I got the white speakers and they are the nice \"Mac\" white plastic. The JBL logo on the speaker itself is awfully big. And the silver volume knob is made of that cheap silver flake paint over plastic which is abit tacky. One of the soft rubber pads on the bottom of these (meant to not scratch your desk) did fall off during opening but they are glued on so no big deal in placing it back on.  The design is very modern and cool tho. They look nice on my desk.You will need to keep these on for abit to let the speakers fully... break in.

It simply plugs into any standard electrical socket and works off the base unit with one of the models mentioned above.This phone was also very easy to register. (It had to be charged for about 2 hours before it could be registered...) I simply had to press the \"MUTE\" button on my base unit and then press the \"PLAY\" button on the phone (the registration directions were even displayed on the LCD display on the phone) Please know that I did find the Panasonic instaltion manual/registration directions to be a little confusing.Some features that are NOT mentioned in this description which ARE included are finger grips/ergonomic sizing on the sides of the phone the opportunity to play your answering machine messages off this phone (the base unit to the KXTG2730 has a digital answering machine and I suspect the other Panasonic models do as well)  THIS WAS THE MAIN REASON WHY I PURCHASED THIS PHONE YES THE KXTGA271V WILL PLAY YOUR ANSWERING MACHINE MESSAGES OFF THIS PHONE THROUGH THE SPEAKER ON THE BACK OF IT a separate \"call waiting\" dedicated button is also included.Also this phone will use any standard headset it does NOT need a Panasonic branded headset. This was very important for me because I ofen use a headset and I do not want to purchase another one. I have since learned that ALL cordless phone headsets can be used on ANY type of cordless phone Please know that the batteries on this phone are not interchangeable with the KXTG2730 system (that is the model that I have.) Also the KXTG2730 phone can\\'t be charged in this charger and vice versa. That is (likely) because the KXTGA271V phone is slightly smaller and weighs less.

The \"white\" in the phone is sort of a shiny metalic white and the \"purple\" is not shiny at all. Some of the buttons are also slightly smaller than the buttons on the KXTG2730 model. And the LCD screen is not flat it is indented slightly and bordered in silver. I purchased this phone from an Amazon.com merchant and am very pleased with it. I noticed that another Amazon.com merchant is selling the same phone that I purchased for less ($30.) however that merchant has HORRIFIC feedback and I was only too glad to pay a little extra for the confidence of knowing that I would receive a phone in a timely manner that would work Panasonic makes very good phones. The only (big) problem is the battery life. The batteries often die after less than 90 minutes. I have solved this problem by purchasing a second set of batteries. However this is still not a perfect solution. So I had to purchase another set of cordless phones (Uniden.) I now keep two phones in each of the rooms that I had each of the Panasonic phones and so far have not run in to any problems. I hope Panasonic will offer batteries with longer lives soon.All in all this is an excellent phone. I hope the extra details that I provided will help a prospective buyer make the right decision. Amazon.com rarely provides specific details to these types of questions (does Amazon.com only employ braindead dimwits?) and the Panasonic Website does not offer this info ',\n",

This case is all that and more...on one side is a detachable cell phone case...the other side a HIDDEN drink holder.

I even fit two books keys a folder filled with directions and plane tickets a notebook and two dvd\\'s in here.

The strap on this bag is extremely sturdy and cushiony. The strap was long enough for me to wear it diagonally accross my chest if I wanted but it is not detachable (which means it isn\\'t likely to fall off easily).This bag is extremely welldesigned. There is a strap for attaching it to wheeled luggage...it even fits under the window seat of the airplane and those areas for storage are much smaller than the aisle seats. Very well padded..I knocked my brand new computer around a bit during the travels and kept opening the case to make sure it was okay Of course it was fine because there are 3 heavy duty layers of padding.Because this bag does all that and more it is large. It becomes larger the more you stuff it (obviously). However I am 5\\'1\" and I carried it fine from North Carolina to New York.

       " \"I've read the other reviews of this product and feel a need to defend this gadget. I've owned mine for about three years and I love it. I use it nightly. The application I find this perfect for is Audio Books stored on MP3. This of one of the only small portable MP3 players that has it's own speakers. I go to bed listening to audio books and I don't want to wear a pair of earphones or lug a set of extra powered speakers around. However just slightly larger than a CD Walkman when folded closed it is small enough to work great on an airline trip where headphones are preferable to the endless roar of the planes engines.The big gripes I've seen repeated in the other reviews are1) Poor radio reception.2) No Bass from the mini speakers.3) Short Battery life.1) I never use this to listen to the radio so I won't comment on it good or bad. But there are thousands of good and cheep radio's on the market so if you need a radio go buy a radio.2) I'll agree with the poor bass reproduction in the speakers. Small cone's yield small bass. It's a physics thing. However when I travel and use this to play music in a hotel room it's been good enough to satisfy the want of a little background music.3) Battery Life. I'm surprised by the times listed by other reviewers. I get about 3035 hours of use when I'm on the road using the AA's. When at home or in a hotel the AC adapter removes the concern about battery life completely. Perhaps this is because I primarily play MP3 disks which it spins up to read into it's buffer then spins down until it needs more data. Anyway I wanted to toss in my two cents as this is a great gadget for audio book listeners and I would hate to see someone miss out on it because some reviewers expected the performance of a boom box or home stereo out of a Walkman sized device.. It's my hope that we'll see more devices like this on the market and the price point to come down a bit.

       " 'First I should say that I\\'m surprised at how sharp and clear the image is.  The display card at CompUSA said this monitor has a 10001 contrast ratio and I\\'m not sure what that means but it definately seems to translate to a crystal clear picture.  The contrast ratio is higher than most other flatpanels I looked at which have a contrast ratio of around 5001 to 7001 (including Samsung\\'s own 20.1\" nonwidescreen model).  Everything is crystalclear which makes it easy on the eyes and good for watching movies.  It is also good for gaming  Halflife 2 and Unreal Tournament 2004 for example both look great.Its widescreen resolution of 1680x1050 is more than decent for most tasks.  It also has a feature that lets you change the aspect ratio to 43 (which makes a square picture centered on the screen) so if you have any games or other applications that don\\'t support widescreen modes you can use 43 mode so that the picture doesn\\'t look stretched and distorted.  Plus the monitor has DVI analog VGA SVideo and RCA inputs (which would allow you to plug in a DVD player if you want).  The monitor can also rotate 90 degrees and it has builtin speakers and a headphone jack.Being a flatpanel display it is also lightweight and compact which is ideal for areas where space is limited.  This is my first flatpanel display and I was surprised at how lightweight it really is.All of these features especially the sharp image make this a great monitor and it is worth the money ',\n",

Also I worried about a loss of sensitivity for my clickwheel.  While it isn't quite as sensitive it makes it more precise in my opinion seeing as how I all of a sudden found myself at the end of my artists lists when I wanted in the S range without the case on.  This blue case even looks good on my black ipod even though I was worried the color would appear muted.  It's still vibrant.  One complaint that some have already brought up is the covered hold button.  Truthfully this doesn't bother me because I have long enough fingernails to dig in and push the button.  But those without could have a great deal of difficulty.  Also the hole for the headset isn't quite large enough and sometimes my headphones will pop out (I'm not using the earbuds that came with the ipod so I do not know how those would fare).  Overall it's a great case that you won't lose your grip on.  It protects well and you never have to take it off even to plug it in.  I would recommend it though it is a bit pricy.

Also they require a 1/4\"to3.5mm (or other) adapter in order to plug into most recent audio playback and computer equipment.These Headphones have been around a long time. Check out the old photos of the \"Watergate\" hearings from 1973/1974 and notice that the Senators &amp attorneys were all listening through KOSS Pro 4AA headphones.  Their longevity is mainly due to their extermely high fidelity audio reproduction. Unfortunately their age has made them somewhat inconvenient for most listeners since they are very heavy and a bit cumbersome.NEGATIVES1) Weight (about 3 or 4 times as heavy as most contemporary studioreference headphones)2) Tight headband  as noted the fit is fatiguing if your \\'hat size\\' is greater than 7 1/2.3) The coiled cord is extremely difficult to replace (it\\'s actually less expensive to replace the entire set of headphones of you can get a good discount).POSITIVES1) AUDIO FIDELITY. Unless you want to spend at least $300 for a set of headphones the sound quality and fidelity of the Pro4AA\\'s is almost impossible to beat.2) VALUE. As noted above for the price you pay these are vastly superior to any other headphones that are comparably priced.3) DURABLE. My first pair lasted 30 years.  They were dropped and knocked around and finally gave out when (It think) a voltage spike surged in the left earphone fusing a coil.4) ISOLATION. THe paddded earphones block out external sound very well.The sound fidelity is preserved over a wide volume range. These sound great at low and high volumes.The biggest Positive (and the reason why I prefer to use Pro4AA\\'s for audio mixing other studio applications and serious listeining) is that they are extremely unlikely to be stolen.  Size matters they are heavy and bulky so they\\'re not easily concealed and since iPOD or MP3 players use the mini plugs these require additional hardware.

       " \"I've owned this headphone for about a year now and I've got to say after going through multiple headphones this beats all others I've tried. If this one ever broke (I doubt that'll happen anytime soon) I'll surely buy another one againPros Comfortable to wear. The ear cushions are indeed comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Even if you wear glasses you won't feel uncomfortable. Clear treble middle and bass. You can hear all the subtle sounds in your song clearly. Even with completely flat EQ setting the headset does very good job with sound (provided you increase the volume up a bit more). As with any headphones take time to 'break it in' to have it function the best it can (it means to leave music playing on the headphone for very extended period of time nonstop about 24 or 32 hours). Sturdy wires. This headphone seems to have been designed based on recording studiolevel headphones in this regard. The wire is very thick and long. Also it's single wire format.Cons Ear padding is perhaps too soft. This means it won't fully cover your ear area and some of sound may leak out. So note that when you listen to your music loud in public places. Although at first few weeks the ear padding is relatively hard. If you are looking for a headphone that will ensure your music will never leak out look into getting inear canal type headphones instead. As some others have pointed out tilting your head too forward or backward will make your headphone just drop from where it is at. So be cautious of your movements. You might not want to wear this kind of headphone during summer due to poor ventilation. But this affects all closed headphones so it's not a huge negative point. The headphone is quite big and on a small head you may have a difficult time keeping it up on your head. The size of the headphone is designed for a fully grown average adult head.That's all I've got to say and overall this headset is definitely worth your money \",\n",

Of course any wireless keyboard will at times not be as responsive as a wired keyboard/mouse setup but this is more than offset by the lack of wires and the ability to pull the keyboard to wherever I wish.The only drawback and it is minor is getting used to the fact that there are no lights on the keyboard to indicate when CAPS LOCK or NUM LOCK is on. I have to look over at the wireless receiver for this. Additionally it would be nice if there was an option for the keyboard to be backlit.

The trackball doesn't has quite as smooth a roll to it as the corded one did but the difference is minimal. I wonder if this may be because it is new and the other one had had years of use.I find the shape of the Logitech Trackman to fit the hand very naturally. It is also much less strenuous on the wrist than a normal mouse which is why I use it.I replaced the corded one so that we could easily move the mouse to different locations for use. This is for home use with multiple users with different mouse location preferences. I took the corded one to use at work where it still performs flawlessly 8+ hours a day.I also have a Logitech cordless keyboard.There are two places where both these items could be improved Each one of these items needs it own receiver. It would save some of my limited home desk space if these could be combined into one unit. I initially had the receivers out of sight behing an LCD monitor.

It is only good in the United States (including Washington DC but MINUS MAINE) but it does not include Guam Virgin Islands etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C. this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is if the manu. warranty is still good you have to use it.4. If the item needs to be shipped shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I\\'m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect and a upon the time of a 4th repair as determined by them they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\\'s warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn\\'t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you  many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for but they all sound typical of such plans (such as they don\\'t cover accidents and they don\\'t cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things).

       " 'I have had this TV since MidMarch 2006. I absolutley love it I did extensive research before I bought a large screen TV and found that this Samsung seemed to give you the most bang for your buck. I read some reviews saying that DLP technology was plagued with problems from the rainbow effect especially in movies with lots of dark scenes and lots of moving action. One reviewer specifically said to try playing \"Bourne Supremecy\" to see an example of the rainbow effect. This was the first dvd I played on this tv and I did not once have a problem with rainbow effect. Overall I have no complaints with this TV. Samsung has produced an excellent product. I recommend either satellite or HD programming for the best picture. Regular cable comes in sort of grainy.As far as where to buy it I recommend Best Buy. I originally was going to buy from Amazon because when I first looked they were offering free shipping. When I decided to buy their was no longer free shipping so off to Best Buy I went where they price matched me with amazon\\'s price no questions asked. Best Buy offers an extended warranty for around $400 that covers bulb replacement or any other problems. It will also cover the rainbow effect on the slight chance that you have any problem with it. Overall a wonderful product ',\n",
       " \"There is a little story before thisI bought a pair of Sony MDRXD100's (they are full cup headphones) because I lost the earbuds which came with my mp3 player (Sony HD5). I took them out of the package and found that even at full volume on the player it cannot drive the headphones sufficently. I went to a few electronics stores then found the KOSS EQ50.On with the reviewYes there is a slight hiss but I find it alright. The biggest gripe I have is that whenever someone within about 23 ft (IE on a bus or subway) uses a cellphone this devices picks it up. You can get the same effect by using a cellphone next to an unshielded pair or speakers. I do most of my listening at home so this won't bo too much of an issue.It also does a great job of amplifying the signal it works very well I can now listen to my XD100's properly (and they are very good). I haven't used the EQ much but what I can say is that it is very very sensitive. Raising the bass slider a third above normal makes a massive difference. At a half my headphones start to distort.If your looking for a nice little EQ and/or preamp this is the product for you. It has its drawbacks though mainly the problem with cellphone interference and of course the hiss but it isn't too loud &amp I can live with it.I reccomend this product if your looking for a budget portable equalizer or headphone amplifer \",\n",

       " \"It is remarkable that even though there are hundreds of iPod cases in existence none of them are nearperfect.  I tried four different cases both hard plastic and silicone variants and the iskin case comes the closest protecting the ipod but at the same time not rendering the ipod less enjoyable to use.The case is basically a hybrid of hard plastic and soft silicone.  The ipod first slips into a silicone sleeve which covers every part of the ipod except for the earphone plug and the screen.  In addition there is a hard plastic plate that is then inserted into seems on the front of the silicone case and this provides the screen protection.  Due to the doubleseam in the silicone the plastic plate never comes in contact with the ipod so you don't have to worry about it scratching.The case even has a flap that covers the dock connector preventing dust from entering yet you can still use the universal dock without removing the case.The most unique part of this case is that it covers the clickwheel but the silicone is so thin that it hardly impedes the scrolling.  Actually I think it provides just enough resistance so that you will overshoot your target much less than with the bare clickwheel.The only real downside I found with the iskin is the clip that comes with itI would not trust it at all so I took it off.  It would be nice to have a better clip that you can actually use and it would be really great to have an armband available for it as well but as I said above I have yet to find a perfect ipod case.  Like most silicone cases this one does also attract lint in your pockets etc. but it is not as bad as other cases.Unfortunately even though this is a great case it is not readily available.  I couldn't find it in any store and Amazon only sells it through Marketplace sellers.  I ordered from Applelinks and they delivered it to me in four days.  Whatever you do don't order from the iSkin company directly.  I have heard countless horror stories of people waiting a month for their cases.

       " 'I tried both Microsoft\\'s LifeCam VX3000 and VX6000. Had \\'em both home and ran trials with my Intel Pentium D Dual Core 3.00GHz CPU with 2 gigs of ram and with both of those the video lagged the audio (distractingly so). Spent the better part of an hour on the phone with a friendly Microsoft customer service rep one evening (got through on their toll free line)and he pointed me to new software for the VX6000. Downloaded the 50 meg plus file installed it but the VX6000 still produced outofsync video vs. audio when I created a simple 640 by 480 video file for viewing on Media Player or editing in Windows Movie Maker. So I talked to some technicians at our company and then talked to the webcam guru at the local assembler that built my I believe excellent computer. All recommended Logitech when buying webcams. I then marched back to Best Buy and traded my $99 Microsoft VX6000 for a Logitech Quickcam Orbit MP for BB\\'s price of $139.95. You can find this Logitech unit cheaper all over the place including of course here at Amazon. The package I bought included an inexpensive headset which I haven\\'t used so far.Although I haven\\'t tried the Orbit in a video phone call yet from the moment I turned it on I had that satisfing good feeling that I bought a winner. Installed fairly easily with a couple of bumps. Got a \"USB composite device has not passed Windows Logo testing\" screen a couple of times..BUT..I received the SAME screen on get this the Microsoft cams I just continued installing and have not experienced system problems so far.The audio sync with video in making a recording is right on (remember that was primary reason for taking back the Microsoft cameras) AND the picture clarity on my LCD flat panel monitor at the 640 webcam capture setting produced a gorgeous picture. Excellent detail and smoothness of video. Besides the superior audio sync with video the Orbit MP is remarkably better than the VX6000 and way above the $49 Microsoft VX3000 in all other criteria too in my opinion after comparison testing.The Orbit\\'s special effects are interesting and fun. The pan tilt etc. excellent. The face tracking is vigorous and alive  fun to watch the little Orbit camera turn  but I haven\\'t tested in actual live conferencing yet.All in all  for webcams I\\'m now saying what more experienced webcam users told me  head for Logitech. They\\'ve certianly hooked me with their apparent superior performance. The Orbit MP is a keeper Not going to waste anymore time searching and testing. And my advice to Microsoft you\\'d better talk to the outfit that bought your name for those Lifecams. I\\'ve relied on the Microsoft name on peripherals keyboards etc. and I\\'ve generally been very satisfied. But in webcams with me the Microsoft brand now takes a back seat to Logitech. ',\n",

       " 'Garmin iQue M5I\\'m very pleased with my little iQue M5 GPS/PDA.  While it\\'s not perfect it\\'s pretty darn amazing. I had actually purchased a Lowrence iWay 350 GPS but then my husband discovered the iQue on sale at Costco for about [...] more.  With the iQue offering so many more features I returned the Lowrence and purchased the iQue.  With my husband and I both having the same machines we can beam information to each other or send them over Bluetooth.It has taken many hours of playing around with it to get to learn the device as it isn\\'t very intuitive and the manuals especially for the PDA are limited. My husband has spent a lot of time learning to use the GPS and he\\'s learning its idiosyncrasies as far as planning routes and getting it to avoid routing through construction areas.  It\\'s very sophisticated and the maps are great  better detail than the Lowrence.  We purchased a 2 Gig memory card and downloaded the entire map database onto it and there were still 300 gigs to spare.  I had no trouble downloading the maps or the Active Sync software.  The basic GPS functions are easy to use once you get the hang of it the voice directions are clear and concise and it reroutes quickly if you go off course.  You can plan your route in advance without having the GPS activated.  This is a good idea since it can take up to 5 minutes for the unit to locate the satellites and you can be on your way if you\\'ve viewed your route before starting out.I used the GPS on a trip Stratford Canada and it was wonderful having the Canadian maps as well as the US maps available. I even used it handheld while walking to my bedandbreakfast from the theater.  Every once in awhile there is a glitch (it said the theater was on the left which would have taken me into the Avon River) but it\\'s generally right on target and I find most of the problems are operator error such as turning too soon. The \"Route to Home\" feature is very convenient. Granted the iQue doesn\\'t always take you on the shortest route but it will get you where you\\'re going and if you\\'re \"directionally challenged\" like I am it becomes indispensible.The car mounting bracket works fine.  It\\'s popped off occasionally in hot weather but generally stays put. The bracket would be easy to move to another vehicle.  The GPS would work in a cupholder if you needed to use it in a rental car.I\\'ve spent more time learning the PDA portion which uses Windows Mobile 2003 2nd Edition. The iQue uses Outlook as its interface so you\\'ll have to have it installed on your computer. Not having used Outlook before I installed Outlook on my laptop and spent some time getting familiar with it which was helpful.  The PDA has so many functions that it\\'s hard to even describe what this little machine can do.  It will organize all of your calendar functions and contacts checks email accesses the Internet if you get a WiFi card recognizes handwriting has a voice recorder interfaces with other Bluetooth units sends alarms has Word and Excel even has a couple of good games.  I got a separate SD card for music and downloaded a lot of songs and the sound through headphones is quite acceptable (it has bass boost).  It uses Windows Media Player so you can organize all of your playlists.  You can download any programs that are available for Windows Mobile 2003 including TV shows and videos.  I never thought I\\'d find much use for a PDA but I\\'m using it every day.  No more little notes on scraps of paper or a separate pocket calendar address book or even an IPod.  Everything is in one handydandy little machine. And even though it isn\\'t that intuitive once you\\'ve learned the basic conventions they translate to most of the programs.We\\'ve called Garmin Tech Support a few times and although they are only open during regular business hours we found American staff who are very knowledgeable about the product.  Since a good GPS will run at least [...] this was a great bargain at around [...]  We\\'ve purchased screen protectors and are hoping it won\\'t wear out too quickly as I\\'ve heard Palm Pilots tend to do.  I\\'m really enjoying the iQue. ',\n",

At times it was a help (like when there was a traffic jam on 95 in VA and we needed an alternate route).  However you definitely have to keep an eye on it as it doesn't always recommend the best or shortest route.  Also it was missing certain stores restaurants etc. that had been around for awhile.We liked that it is a PDA though.

       " \"I had been talking about wanting an MP3 player but I did NOT want an iPod as I heard you cannot add files in Windows format and that's what all of my music is.  I received this e260 4 GB MP3 player for my birthday in June 2006 and this is the first MP3 player I have ever owned.  Although there are a few little quirks overall I am not disappointed and would recommend this MP3 player.Like many rechargeable batterypowered items it required a lengthy initial charge before first use.  After that the future charges don't seem to take as long.  The MP3 player plays for hours on end without needing a new charge.  Although I've never run it completely down I have used it continuously for about 4 hours with no battery issues.I installed the software on my computer and the disk is where you will find the owner's manual.  I was a bit irritated that there was no hard copy of the owner's manual and just a few weeks ago it came up as an issue when my MP3 player froze and I had to turn on the computer to look up the troubleshooting guide (turns out if the player freezes you need to hold the power button down for about 15 seconds to reset it). It came preloaded with 20 songs only one of which I had ever heard of (and it was one of those noname bands that played once on Saturday Night Live).  Although my first instinct was to delete the songs to make room for my own choices I decided to leave them on there until I need the space.  About three of the songs have grown on me a little bit over the past 5 months.  I currently have 517 songs on there and still have room for more.As far as performance goes it performs pretty well.  The buttons are a little difficult to get used to as you navigate through the functions and the song lists by scrolling a wheel.  Not too bad but when you turn on the player and it begins at the beginning of the list and you want a song that's in the middle and you have a lot of songs on there you will be scrolling a lot.  I do not use all the functions that came with this MP3 player.  It has music fm radio photo voice video and a settings option.  I have used the music function and the voice recorder option both with good results.  The only downside to the voice recorder is that you can't get the recordings you made off the MP3 player and onto your computer.  It would have been nice to be able to record things and sync them onto your computer.  As for syncing music files I have not had any problems although I did have one instance where it shows a song was downloaded but when you try to play it it skips to the next song alphabetically in the list.  I don't know what caused this.  Also you can only store a song as one genre which is a little annoying.  Be sure you have your genres picked before you sync because once the song is on the MP3 player you cannot change the genre.It came with a headset but I have never used it.  Instead I purchased some Panasonic folding travel speakers to use with it.  I do wish the MP3 player had some alternate form of charging other than needing to be connected to my computer's USB drive to charge.  Another con is that a scratch of some sort appeared on the inside surface of the screen.  I can't remember it being dropped or anything so I don't know what caused this but it's pretty noticeable.  It doesn't seem to affect the operation just the aesthetics.Overall the cons are little irritations to me and I would recommend this player to someone who doesn't want an iPod \",\n",

The photo output is awesome and it\\'s very fastThere are only two things I would comment on that new users might not be aware of. I was ready to return the printer as I thought it was defective until I found out what the problems were.1) When the cartridges dry out it will tell you that the cartridges are incompatible. This was confusing as I did have the correct cartridges in the printer. A \"replace cartridge\" message would have been less ambiguous.2) The printer has so far appeared \"dead\" once. When I went to turn it on it would not do so. The solution is on HP\\'s website  you must remove the rear door and do a hard reset.

       " 'I\\'m a skeptic. No I mean I\\'m REALLY a skeptic... especially in today\\'s marketplace (because nothing is built like it used to be). I don\\'t buy anything without checking it out first and even then I expect that it\\'s probably going to fail me when I do. Yeah wonderful view there huh?Well needless to say I was pleasantly (and quite happily) surprised when this device didn\\'t fail me out of the box. I\\'ve been using my speedpad for almost a year now and I have to say that it has been by far more solid responsive and intuitive than I ever expected it to be. I will not play a PC game without it plugged in now that\\'s how well this gamepad has worked for me.Here are the ins and outs1) Solid construction. As others have stated this device feels very solid and is just generally \"sturdy as hell\". This alone surprised me. Not too many electronic devices are solidly made these days (not too many at all)... so I\\'m glad to see that this one was. Belkin did an excellent job in this department.2) Software. Do yourself a favor when you get this device home don\\'t bother putting in the CD that comes with it. Instead go directly to Belkin\\'s website firstthing download the newer version of the software (which is near exactly the same as what\\'s on the CD but updated) and install that *before* plugging in your speedpad for the first time. Do that and you\\'ll have everything updated immediately with little to no trouble at all.I\\'ve had no problems with the software for this hardware (and that\\'s generally the part I have trouble with the most). The applications (profiler and button editor) function perfectly and macros are a snap to program. Kudos to Belkin\\'s programmers on writing the software suite for this they did a good job.4) Sticky keys. Most people have experienced this.. myself included. Being possibly a byproduct of the solid construction of the product basically what happens is the keys stick just a little bit coming out of the box. Though just \"excercising\" the device (pressing the buttons down quickly and solidly over and over) for a few seconds after plugging it in each time I went to use it cleared up this issue within the first week of using the gamepad and I\\'ve never had it happen since. 5) Other buttons. * The mouse scroll wheel can be an annoyance and I don\\'t use it much at all because it\\'s hard to scroll up and down with it (Belkin may just have made that particular button a little *too* solid). * The orange button above the dpad also isn\\'t that easy to press though if you keep you pinky finger positioned on the side of the keypad for leverage it\\'s not impossible to press this button (in fact I use it as my default \"map\" button in most of the games I play). It\\'s perfect for those functions you use enough to need a button for but not enough to need an easy spam button.* I haven\\'t experienced any problems hitting the \\'space\\' button below the dpad that others have experienced. My thumb taps that button as easily as it taps the space bar on a standard keyboard. My only complaint with it is that I can\\'t simply twist my thumb a bit to hit the key I have to actually lift my thumb off the dpad to do it  and that\\'s not much of a complaint at all really.The dpad itself is a godsend I\\'m a true console gamer having used nothing but dpads for movement since all the time spent playing my old NES as a kid (and using a joystick before that with my even older Atari). Dpad is all I know really. In fact the one thing that\\'s kept me away from PC gaming all these years is I\\'ve never ever been able to accustom myself to using arrow keys or WASD for movement (and probably never will get accustomed to that either). For the longest time I was looking for a device that could allow me to keep the sensitivity of mouse aiming (to keep up with other PC players) while giving me an actual dpad for movement... and that is EXACTLY what this gamepad did for me. As I said at the top of this review I will never play a PC game without my Nostromo speedpad plugged in. This gamepad has provided the one benefit that other pads haven\\'t and that I really needed  a controller interface that\\'s actually functional and intuitive enough to use that I forget I\\'m using it most of the time allowing me to immerse myself completely in whatever game I\\'m playing... which is really the point of gaming in the first place isn\\'t it? The Nostromo Speedpad gets 5 stars from me. I would recommend it to anyone who\\'s looking for the type of benefits I\\'ve listed. And for that matter I\\'m recommending it right now in fact...

But if you're looking for a quality 3inone in the $100 to $150 range this one seems to be at the top of the pack.There are nicer printers out there in this price range.  However you will be severely penalized when it comes to purchasing ink.  HewlettPackard printers tend to be the most friendly when it comes to buying refilled cartridges or refilling your own cartridges.It prints fast it prints well and I enjoy the doublesided printing feature.  This printer has been consistently rated by users as being accurate in its color prints although I've done little color printing myself.The scans are not the greatest as they leave small artifacts at regular intervals when you zoom in in Photoshop.  The artifact is a vertical line which bisects the picture and offsets each side by a few pixels.  They're not really noticeable to the naked eye and you won't see them unless you're editing the picture and have blown it up considerably.  Still it's probably not the best for archiving your photos.

       " 'Here is the original review of this machine I wrote on June 17 2006We bought this machine just over a year ago (a year and two weeks to be specific).  We had another very similar Panasonic DVD recorder (DMRE55) in a different room and wanted to be able to record and watch DVDRAMs on both.  For a long time the ES10S recorder worked fine.  Recently though it has begun making noises when starting up and shutting down and now it occasionally has problems reading the disks ejecting them and even playing them.  At first we thought this might be because we\\'d recorded over the DVDRAMs so many times.  But today we tested one of them in the other machine which has never made any similar noises and the E55 had no problems with it.  Needless to say we\\'re not happy that the ES10S seems to be dying especially since the 1year warranty just ended.  If you buy or own this machine follow up on any strange noises as soon as you hear them if you\\'re within the warranty period because the noises and problems just get worse.  Panasonic is usually a reliable brand one we\\'ve used for many years but this machine seems to be a lemon.  We\\'re actually going to write to Panasonic about itI\\'ll try to post again with the results.Here is my update which I wrote November 3This is a followup review to the one above which I wrote on June 17. I wrote to Panasonic after my machine had stopped working just after the warranty ended. They sent me a nice letter authorizing a free repair including labor of the machine at one of three places they listed. The places were all within a halfhour drive of my home. After doing some research I chose one and brought in the machine. They fixed it by replacing \"the entire internal mechanism\" (I don\\'t know what that means). We got the machine back from the repair shop near the end of July it\\'s now the beginning of November. The fixed machine worked fine for a while but in the past few weeks we\\'ve been hearing the same old noises that were the beginning of the end for it before. I\\'m going to try writing to Panasonic again and asking for a refund because this machine really seems to have something fundamentally wrong with it. It\\'s still working but I know from the last time with these noises and efforts to read the disks that soon it won\\'t. Avoid this machine. Again the previous Panasonic model (DMRE55) we bought hasn\\'t had any of these difficulties and continues to work great. We\\'re still big Panasonic fans but this particular model is a lemon. ',\n",

Hiss abounds several local stations I heard previously are now unreachable and to top it off Sony has stuck with their timehonored habit of using proprietary connectors so when I went to plug in an aftermarket antenna to get better reception I found a weird little plug that I hadn't noticed when I put the damned thing together.  Grrr.  So now I'm going to sell this thing and buy a nice new Panasonic with the proceeds.  Death to Sony \",\n",
       " \"I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works I have very infrequent power outages perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS \",\n",

But I tried a local test first.  I used roads as waypoints main roads.  This way I can force the Tomtom to use MY routes.  I did not like it's choices since it is a dated map database.  I set up a local route and started to follow it.  It took me to the first road/waypoint no problem.  But it would not go past the first waypoint.  I would go down the road (first waypoint) then it would tell me to take a u turn.  I did.  Then it said take another u turn.  It had me going in circles.

I soon realized that I needed more ports and more convenience than the two now located in the backplane of the PC on the floor.I shopped around and this item looked appropriate. As for the short cord I solved that issue by getting a USB extension cord at the same time. Besides solving the immediate problem this approach gave me the option of moving the hub to my laptop at some point and using the extension cord for some other purpose.For a long time it did exactly what it was supposed to do. I attached an external hard drive through it. I used it for a compact flash card reader and a digital camera. I connected an inkjet printer. Everything worked once the drivers were installed and everything was set up correctly. (This was all with Windows 98 SE.)But after a while things started getting less reliable. The system would tell me that various \"drives\" (on the flash card reader or the external hard drive) were not available. Or the digital camera would not stay connected to its software. And the printer even started disappearing.Playing with the cables and connectors would sometimes bring devices back to life and eventually I deduced that there was something wrong either with the connectors themselves being too loose or with wiring inside the device. Either way it has finally become a big problem and I am shopping for a replacement.Most of the devices I connected were selfpowered that is they did not need to draw power from the hub or the PCI channel at all. The hard drive camera and printer were all powered by batteries or AC adapters of their own. And the flash card reader which did draw power from the hub used to work fine. It does not matter what combination of devices I try sooner or later the connection goes bad.It is of course possible that there\\'s something wrong in the PC  but that would not explain why things are improved by messing with the connectors or the hub itself. So I have to recommend against buying it. I suspect it is discontinued and that this advice won\\'t be necessary for much longer but I want to prevent somebody from the bother I\\'ve been through just in case ',\n",

       " 'My Sangean DT200V pocket radio failed after 2.5 years of infrequent use.  I kept it in a padded pocket of my briefcase where it experienced no significant shocks or temperature extremes.  It worked perfectly on the few occasions when I used it over the 2.5 year period until yesterday.  The buttons switches and display still work perfectly but only very faint white noise can be heard whether via speaker or via earphone.  The volumn of the faint white noise is not significantly affected by the volumn control.  The batteries are new and there is no corrosion from the previous batteries.  ',\n",
       " \"Perhaps I got a lemon but I feel wary of buying another DT200V for 2 reasons1.  From the day I got it the power button was so sensitive that a tiny waft of air (no kidding) would turn it off (or back on) at whim.  Right in the middle of a song or talk this shortly became maddening.Since this is unacceptable for a $50range radio and since I didn't want to spend as much money mailing it to and fro as it was worth instead of sending it back (OH looking back how I should have) I opened it up myself and had to physically shave down the plastic underside of the on/off button where it touched the internal power switch.  As I couldn't conversely move the guts further from the button this was the only solution.Thankfully this worked and the on/off button did not give me further problems after this.However2.  Not many weeks or months of use in the radio developed this habit of shorting out or something to where my preset stations just scanned as blank 'fuzz' (no station not even 'intelligent' fuzz/crackle like it knew a station existed anywhere on the planet) and I could get zero stations of anything at allnot FM not AM and no TV.This would happen right after turning the radio on and I should note that I always used headphones (not the ones supplied as with most throw them away they're not worth it).  It seemed to me through trial and error that just turning the radio on was fine but the act of plugging in some headphones joggled some connection or shorted something out and did this.I tried several different pair and types of headphones (some with noise cancelling switches some without and with these On and Off) and used the 'lock' switch on the radio both in the on and off position while plugging in my headphones (as the company I bought them from recommended turning the lock switch on when changing batteries to prevent shorts) but nothing I have done has prevented this from eventually happening again...repeatedly.It is really annoying when it does as removing the batteries (which always will lose all your presets by the way) and waiting several minutes rarely clears the short.Weirdly the thing I've found which clears the short or remakes whatever connection is messed up correct itself is opening up the back (screwdriver required) and kind of pushing the guts (board) one direction or another kind of scooting it (there's minimal movement available though) and saying a little prayer and putting the whole thing back together again.  Most of the time that has worked.  Occasionally I've had to repeat the process 35 times before it will.Sometimes it lasts several weeks before this'll happen again other times it happens multiple times a day.  The day I can't fix it (I don't even know what I'm doing that's fixing it) I'll throw it across the room against a wall and I probably _won't_ buy another one.(If I do I'm keeping the receipt NEVER opening up the back as it voids any warranty and returning it (not for repairsfor a refund) the split second it gives me any trouble of any kind.)For all this I grudgingly say that it does have very good reception quality of FM (I almost exclusively listen to this) pulls the stations in nicely and has very low amount of static.  When one particular station does it's usually more the fault of distance or we're getting out of range or the batteries are very low that's at fault.Indoors in a computersaturated officecubby environment and not near a window though I'd have to say it has had some significant problems pulling in any more than 34 strongsignal stations without major static.  But your office environs may vary.  (Some are more electrical field saturated than most.)The FM (musical) sound quality itself is good/decent and I might say better than many...but my 1 criticism on it is a certain 'canniness' of sound quality (across various headphones I've plugged in).  It's lacking some fullness of the midrange and warmth.  Also the bass is not what it could be.  I'm not sure given its overall sound quality signature if the addition of a bass boost button would have helped it or not.For me clarity and volume have helped me ignore some of the lesser aspects of the DT200V's sound signature.  However shopping for my next purchase that will move up higher in importance \",\n",

       " \"                  After reading the detailed reports here for how to setup this Linksys gaming adapter unit everything worked great for several days. I setup the fixed IPs and all the rest of the settings through the web interface all seemed well. Note I'm a network engineer so the dualfixedip recommendation [one for each segment] is actually pretty normal in other network bridging appliances. I suspect the MS game adapter simply performs the DHCP handshake better than this unit and that is why it is so easy to setup. Then the weird stuff started. After having had this unit turned on for several days I notice the connection would become slow and not quite as fast as when the Linksys is first turned on. Yet the XBOX still shows the signal between 48 and 54 Mbps. Strange. I have reproduced this several times booting the linksys device then playing all kinds of games online for hours running XBMC and playing media through the network perfectly. All is good for several hours but come back the next day after leaving the Linksys on all day/night turn on the XBOX and the network connection is spotty again but the link details show a full speed connection in the XBOX wireless interface details. A swift power cycle of the Linksys unit solves the problem immediately but why should I need to do this? I suspect some NIC buffer is being filled on the Linksys and the power cycle clears out the unit's network buffers. If anyone has figured out what settings to use to keep this thing stable I am ready to listen maybe I should select a Gonly network and set the speed at 54 or 48 fixed maybe that will work? Anyway I am getting tired of power cycling this thing every day. Good Luck F.  \",\n",

       " 'I recently purchased a refurbished Toshiba Gigabeat F40 for about $150. Quite a bargain for a 40gig MP3 player. However upon reflection I regret the purchase.The Gigabeat hardware seems to be OK with good sound quality etc. The major failing is with the included software. As other reviews have pointed out the Gigabeat will only play encrypted tracks. The Gigabeat is supplied with Gigabeat Room application software to provide the necessary encryption. Gigabeat Room starts automatically when connected to the PC via the USB port. From the time the Gigabeat is connected till the Gigabeat Room application is displayed on the screen is 30 minutes. If you switch from viewing the Gigabeat file directory to the PC file directory the application hangs. If you try to update your track library the application hangs. I have yet to get  through a single operation from beginning to end without the program hanging. Every time the Gigabeat Room hangs you have to restart the application with yet another 30minute wait to resume. The file directory on the Gigabeat is usually out of sync with what is actually present on the hard drive. Microsoft Media Player version 10 may also be used to synchronize the Gigabeat. I have a 35gig library. It took Media Player 18 hours to encrypt and copy all 8100 tracks to the Gigabeat. In short be prepared for a maddening and time consuming experience with this player. Software that gives error messages such as \"The Program Is Quitted\" and with such obvious fragility may have been expected in 1986 but is absolutely unreasonable in 2006.In my estimation you would be much better off purchasing an MP3 player even at greater cost that can play MP3 files directly with file maintenance provided by Windows Explorer and or Media Player.

It takes FOREVER to scroll through the songs artists or albums.  Why the hell would Alpine put out a product that has an inferior scrolling mechanism and then lock you out of the iPod so you can\\'t even select songs from the iPod itself?  I have over 3000 songs on my iPod... by the time I scroll to the song I want I\\'ve already reached my destination... and that\\'s if I even find the song at all  So now what I have to do is unplug my iPod scroll to the song I want then plug it back in. (Luckily the reciever continues to play whatever song was already playing when you plug your iPod in.)  But again... that defeats the whole point of having the controls built into the deck.  Bottom line the iPod control feature flat SUCKS.  The deck features a \"quick search\" function... but it is uselss... it isn\\'t used to search through artsts or albums... only individual songs and there\\'s no way to skip 10 20 30 or 100 songs at a time... only 1 by 1... What\\'s \"quick\" about that?   I have 3000 songs and hundreds of artists and albums and Alpine thinks I\\'m supposed to go through them 1 by 1???? Another annoying thing about this unit is that when you skip through songs while the iPod is playing the display just says \"song up\" or \"song down\" instead of just showing the name of the damn song  Who thought of that?  What possible help could \"song up\" be to anyone? Just show the name of the song while I\\'m skipping through... that makes more sense right?  There are a bunch of other problems I have with the practicalness of this unit when used with the iPod adapter and iPod... but the sound quality is great which is the most important thing... but then again... who cares if the sound is great when it takes you all day to find the song you want to listen to ',\n",
       " 'I bought an Alpine 9847 and the Ipod interface. I works but it totally hijacks your Ipod. The beautiful intuitve fast controls on the Ipod itself are locked out and you can ONLY control the Ipod from the car stereo. It is therefore very hard to deal with especially if you have a large music catalog on you Ipod. It is very slow not at all intuitive. Even after getting used to it it is no good. The info on artist album or song title imports from the IPod very slowly. Turning the volume knob is equivalent to circling on the Ipod but one turn eqauls about 3 spots on the list unlike one circle on the Ipod which equals dozens of spots on the list. Therefore if you have a large catalog you have to spin the volume knob 100 times to get thru a long catalog list which takes forever........Very annoying very slow very cumbersome. If only it did not deactivate the normal controls on the Ipod itself. A better and much cheaper solution is to find a car stereo with some form of line in either stereo mini plug or RCA jacks. The just connect directly and use the IPods own controls which are infinitely better. I replace an old stereo to get the Ipod option and am very sorry I did so ',\n",

The software can move the files between the recorder and the computer but the files do not appear in the software window.  The use interface is also fairly crude and looks as if it was ported directly from Windows 3.1.  The DS2 appears to the finder as a standard USB disk and I have been able to copy the DSS files from the player to the compuer using the finder.  It is then possible to play the DSS files by double clicking them but it will only play one file.  If you want to play another file it is necessary to completely quit the DSS player and relanch it.  Exporting the files to a format usable by other software such as AIFF is also nearly impossible.  There is an export function in the menu when it is selected it asks were the new file should be saved but no file ever appears.  Unfortunately there is no other Macintosh software available to read or convert DSS files as Olympus refuses to allow others use the the format on the Macintosh.  Search of the internet reveals that others have found extremely painful ways of converting the DSS files such as playing the entire file and rerecording it with another program ',\n",

It is similar to wearing a stethescope which defeats the point of wearing intheear headphones (which are supposed to reduce the ambient noise).

I went around and around with this fellow then finally asked for his supervisor. After another 15 minutes on hold another guy came on the line who was pretty fluent in English.

He had me turn the computer on and off which of course I had already done several times and check the monitor connection. After this analysis he determined that the situation could not possibly have been the result of the frozen software installation that occurred just prior to it and must be some other problem with my PC that had previously been working perfectly that coincidently occurred at the exact same time as the software freeze. I expressed skepticism towards this explanation and asked him if he would believe that if it was his PC. He said that absolutely he would and reassured me that there was NO POSSIBLE WAY (emphasis his) that his software could have caused these symptoms.

       " 'I bought this adapter along with the Linksys WRT54GL Broadband Router.  I managed to set them up and install them properly.  (The best advice I got from the \"Home Networking for Dummies\" book was to get a 100 foot Cat5e patch cable so that I could put my router in the place I where I wanted it and hook it up with a wired connection first.  I actually only needed a 50 foot cable and got it for $20 from a local electronics supply store.)So I got everything up and running (remember to install your router first and then your network adapter) surfed the internet for awhile and then shut down my computer.  Here\\'s where the trouble started....As other reviewers have noted the Linksys installation makes changes to your Windows XP configuration deactivating the Welcome screen and the feature Microsoft calls \"Fast User Switching.\"  This happens with no warning.When I went to turn on my computer again I got a new startup screen for Windows demanding a password.  I freaked out because I don\\'t remember ever setting a password for Windows.  I called Linksys and was extremely unimpressed with their customer support.  The young woman seemed to be amused by my problem and was actually laughing at me.  She began to start me through the process of completely resetting the router to the factory settings (this would NOT have helped).What finally helped was figuring out (with no help from Linksys) that if you never set a password for your Windows XP logon all you have to do is hit \"Enter\" at the password prompt.  That\\'s all there is.  Linksys could have told me this or better yet warned before installation that these changes to Windows XP would take place and suggest setting up a User Password in advance.Another gripe about this network adapter and the Linksys routerneither came with instruction manuals.  There is a 60page instruction manual on the CD rom that comes with the product but you\\'ll have to print it out yourself (Do it before you install or try installing the product).  In the case of the router I also had to do deep searching to actually find the instruction manual on the CDROMit wanted to start up the Setup Wizard automatically and the instruction manual was not easy to access from the CDROM.  I guess this may be the norm now with computer hardware but it still stinks.I do not recommend the Linksys WUSB54GC primarily because of the unannounced changes it makes to the Windows XP system and because of Linksys\\' nonexistent or nonfunctional and rude customer support ',\n",
       " \"I have owned the TomTom Navigator 5 for almost a year now.  While the program is well thought out and provides a good function it does not work well with my Tungsten T5.  I have contacted customer service 4 times now and they have always been helpful in trying to fix my issues (listed below) but to no avail.  Some of the issues I have hadAny time the software has to redirect or think it locks up.  If I stay on the original planned route it sometimes works properly...In a 30 minute trip from Orange County to Long Beach I had to pull over 7 times to reset my device after the software locked up.Voices lock up mid sentence giving a stuttering sound until you are able to pull your car over to reset the device.In a 20 minute trip from San Francisco to Oakland the device locked up 5 times.  I finally gave up and called a friend to guide me.Bear in mind I have had no problems with my T5 in the 1.5 years of ownership...it is only with this software.  Customer service has acknowledged the problems and given solutions that have solved little to nothing.  In summary it's not worth spending the money to have to print out Mapquest directions to have when the device crashes...stick with Mapquest \",\n",
       " \" Essentially once TomTom has your money they're finished with you . . . until you want to spend more money with them. The product is okay. The map data is from TeleAtlas a vendor to many of the map software producers. What makes TomTom different is its GUI (Graphic User Interface) that the user interacts with. It really is a work of art most of the time. The map presentations are rich and may be viewed as 3D or 2D. The planning interface is icon driven and easytouse. Unfortunately TomTom really didn't think it all the way through. There are several irritants all of which vie for first place. One is that TomTom doesn't give you the option of using its maps without a GPS. There are many instances where I know where I am begining from and going to and I don't need a GPS fix. TomTom ignores such desires and annoyingly keeps prompting for you to start your Bluetooth connection. There is one mode that you can use to plan a route without a GPS and it simply doesn't work very well often informing you that TomTom can't route you from a point beginning on an interstate to another point further along the same highway. That's just plain dumb. This is a mapping application. If I want to use these expensive maps for walking directions without a GPS I should be able to. TomTom certainly doesn't think so. Another irritant is the documentation. Probably in an effort to make TomTom appealing to the casual user the documentation is dog simple . . . and often wrong. It appears that they didn't update the documentation to the newest version. Although you can load maps by region TomTom makes no allowance for travelling from one region to another. You have to calculate your route to the ending point within one region and then begin it anew in the next region. Again this strikes me as a silly omission. If you are in Wisconsin which is one region and drive to Minnesota which is in another you have to create two routes. Not bright. There are a number of idiosyncracies anomalies and bugs that drive me up a wall. However overall TomTom is still better than the competition. It computes routes quickly (when it is capable of figuring a route at all). Annoying however it tends to prefer expressways regardless of your preferences. In a major metro area laced with expressways going in all directions this can create some incredibly convoluted  and ridiculous  routes. Creating alternative and more logical routes is possible but tedious. The worst part of the TomTom experience is its customer support. Well perhaps support is the wrong word for it. I encountered two problems installing the software. It was obviously that the tech support person was clueless and was simply guessing and grasping at straws. (I had resolved the issues before the rep called and already knew what the problem was.) The TomTom rep didn't listen kept interrupting and when it was pointed out that he was contradicting the manual he just kept moving. (The manual in at least one instance was correct and the rep wrong.) The TomTom packaging itself arrived in broken condition. The rep denied it was their packaging claiming that I must have bought a thirdparty repackaged product. Talk about insulting I have the package in front of me with the TomTom labels the whole works and this guy is telling me that my lying eyes are deceiving me? A fax to TomTom management about my experiences has gone unanswered more than a week later. TomTom is riding high right now but I suspect in a couple of years as competitors introduce better products with better support that TomTom will be history. It won't be the first company that offered a goodenough product without support and possesing contempt for its customers to disappear and it won't be the last. I know that if I find a marginally better product with adequate support I'd abandon TomTom in a flash.Jerr \",\n",
       " \"The TomTom Navigator is a nice enough device until you get to the Maps activation. The Maps activation? Why should I have to activate my maps if I have paid for the product? Good question well I activated these maps on one PDA and within 2 weeks my PDA died and I had to obtain warranty service. Well I decided that I would upgrade to a new device and then sell my old device when I got it back from the manufacturers (I tend to switch my PDA every 34 months anyway).So I installed the maps on the new device and it asked me to activate. OK I figure...no problem I will be able to activate it 1...2...3 because after all only I have the activation card/code. No such luck TomTom wants PROOF that I have brought a new device? what kind of nonsense is that? What if I lost my PDA in 23 months? What if I'm a nut who likes to change PDA's every 34 months? What you mean I have to show you proof that I switched? Isn't the fact that I have the activation card proof enough? I don't know too many people who pay $269 for a product and let other people use the activation codes.Avoid them at all costs. You will regret your purchase if you change devices frequently.One other problem with this product...out of the box it is not 100% compatible with Windows Mobile 5 devices (most of the new Axims are WM5.

Its a solid unit. It costs a little more but you won't be replacing your GPS unit due to it falling to the ground. \",\n",
       " \"  My company car has a builtin GPS unit and I have gotten to like it sortof.  I have gotten lost in a rental car trolling around Silicon Valley enough to get a portable GPS unit.  After some research the Garmin iQue 3600 is what I ended up with and I paid about $700.  The unique feature of this portable GPS unit is that a PalmPilot comes integrated into the package.   I use a PalmPilot so this GPS unit replaces my PalmV.    Installation was quite awkward and getting it up and running was a chore.   I got the thing synced up and some maps loaded and have been using it for several months now.  It does do the job fitfully and has several glaring issues.  Most irritating the Palm function and the GPS function are not seamlessly integrated.  If an address is entered in the Palm part and then route to this address is selected the iQue 3600 makes you find the location.  But the address from the Palm section doesn't transfer cleanly into the find section and you must retype the address.  I'm lefthanded and graffiti has NEVER worked for me all my letters are drawn backward.  The GPS can be engaged as soon as it recognizes where you want to go but my unit takes a good 510 minutes to find the satellites when first exposed to sky.   This means that I must have a good idea what to do for the first 510 minutes.  Sometimes I just drive randomly until the GPS locks in and starts to issue navigation orders.  Also the antenna must be deployed to get any GPS reception and must be forward enough in the windshield to see sky.  This is OK except that the iQue 3600 doesn't tell you that the antenna has not been deployed.    The iQue 3600 does not work propped up on the passenger seat so a 5 pound holder is necessary to hold the unit on the dashboard.  If the antenna is not deployed the iQue 3600 simply doesn't navigate and doesn't tell you why.  Worse it acts stupid by going into a dangerous and unhelpful simulate mode.  If I ever figure out what that means Ill tell you in a future post.  I figured out the antenna problem the hard way in an ice storm outside of Ottawa.  I'm a fan of GUI design and I must say that the UI here is very very bad.  Not the worse I have ever seen but very bad  nonintuitive inconsistent and arbitrary.  The FIND function/button has an entirely different function in the GPS section from the Palm section.  Of course the same icon is used.  I cannot imagine grandma using this thing to navigate.  What little there is of the very pretty documentation is atrocious.  About 10 times more information is needed here.  It shuts down randomly on occasion for no apparent purpose (Battery savings maybe?).  The secure digital card is too small (max of 256MB) so you can't put more than a few California counties in the memory.  Maps storage is managed with a rather hostile GUI.  This is not fatal but is irritating.  I would rather put a 1GB SD card in the iQue 3600 and be done with it.  The iQue 3600 burns too much power to be used as a portable so it must always be tethered to the car or resting in the cradle.  I don't find the power issue to be a problem.  I understand that to get clear bright screens it is necessary to use power.  I agree with the tradeoff here. \",\n",

       " \"I'm a longtime user of Wacom Intuos tablets and I was looking for something similar with wireless capabilities for my new dual 2.5ghzG5. There were no wireless Intuos products available at the time of purchase so I went with the Graphire Bluetooth. Unfortunately the product leaves a lot to be desired and after a couple of weeks of use I plan on returning it. The major problem lies with the penboth in design and responsiveness. Design the Graphire series is cheaper than the Intuos and there's a good reason why the Graphire pen is thinner lighter and has no grip. If you have very small hands this might be acceptable in my hand this feels like a toothpick. It's very difficult to manipulate a tool effectively when it doesn't feel like it has any durability. Additionally the Graphire pen stand is little more than a piece of transparent molded plastic and slides around the desk whenever I put the pen back into it.Responsiveness There is a halfsecond delay whenever using the pen to click in any finderrelated optionsopening windows selecting files etc. 1/2 second may sound acceptable but if you like me use the pen for everything not just drawing believe me it is utterly maddening. On the other hand the mouse behaves perfectly with no delay at all so I know it's the pen and not my computer.The tablet is attractive and the mouse works fine but the bottom line is that it's more important for me to have a responsive durable pen than a wireless tablet. If you've never used an Intuos you may not recognize the deficiencies but for those who have this is like going from a Mercedes to a Honda Civic.

Has a sharp image but includes a catalog of chromatic aberrations from offcolor skin tones to color blotching dirty grays burned highlights murky shadows noisy reds and poor color balance due to impedance mismatching that results in cyan errors and bleeding reds. Makes video test patterns look great but who watches test patterns all day? Amazon offers many other brands at good prices why waste your $$ on this stuff? I removed every piece of Monster from my system and replaced them with AR Belden Viewsonics and others from Amazon. Result vast improvement in every respect. \",\n",

       " 'I purchased this for my Intel iMac mainly because I was so frustrated with the Mighty Mouse.  I wanted something with two separate buttons.  I had tried the Logitech MX 610 (which I purchased as well for another computer) and thought that the ergonomic shape felt wonderful.  So I purchased this desktop set because I wanted it to match my Mac and so I could have a proper 2 button mouse.  I figured the Mac keyboard could use improvement as well so the keyboard could come in handy as well.  In fact I thought I would get added convenience since this was a keyboard designed for a Mac and had extra shortcut buttons.Other than having 2 separate buttons on the mouse this keyboard/mouse combo has been an utter disappointment.First of all the white doesn\\'t quite match.  It\\'s close but just a touch too cream.  Also there\\'s just too much silver.  Especially on the mouse.Secondly it doesn\\'t have all the buttons the Mighty Mouse does.  There is no button to switch to the Widgets.  Luckily you can press F12 on the keyboard.  Not quite as convenient but still possible.  However I have yet to find a button that allows you to switch between various open programs.  This is especially necessary if you have multiple web browsers open.Thirdly this mouse just doesn\\'t work as well as other Logitechs.  It is too light lacking the \"feel\" and a bit of the comforting weight that the MX 610 has when you move it around.  Also the speed of the cursor is off.  No matter how I try to adjust the speed it doesn\\'t quite match the speed of the original Mighty Mouse.  It is either too fast or too slow.  I think part of it is simply OSX\\'s lack of adjustability compared to [gasp] Windows for cursor speed.Finally the keyboard is simply atrocious.  I don\\'t even use it anymore.  It\\'s packed up in the box and I plugged the original Mac keyboard back in.  The keys make a horrendous clatter when typing.  The pressure is nonexistant making touch typing just a bit more difficult than normal.  Also the depth is quite shallow.  This is a desktop keyboard.  You can press the key down further on nearly all the laptop keyboards I\\'ve tried.  Also the texture of the keys is far too smooth and uniform.  The raised dots to help you find the F or J buttons is too shallow.  I can\\'t find the asdf an jkl rows by touch.  I have to look.  As a touch typist this is an unforgiveable sin.  It basically transforms you from a touch typist to a hunt and peck typer who has to visually find each key before you can hit it.  I\\'m typing on a Thinkpad whose laptop keyboard is far superior to this Logitech.So in short save your money and avoid this keyboard/mouse combo.  I rated it a two because the mouse did have 2 separate buttons unlike the Mighty Mouse which is why I purchased this in the first place.  It hit my most basic requirement.  Otherwise it really deserves a 1 star rating ',\n",

My XP system recognized the camera but told me that the hardware had encountered an error during installation and may not function properly.  I uninstalled the software and tried the installation again with the same result.  I then tried a different USB port just in case there was a problem.  Following a stepwise process I checked and updated all drivers for the USB hub ports etc. and I checked under the system manager tools to ensure that all were working properly.  I then went to the microsoft website and downloaded the updates for the software (this took another 15 minutes and the site crashed twice).By now I was getting very frustrated but hoped that the software update would allow appropriate conectivity with the camera.  I went into the software and found that it was recognizing the mic but it said that there was no camera attached.  I again tried to find the camera through other means with no results.For the price paid and the 3+ hours I spent trying to install the hardware I can say with all assurity that this product is not worth it.

       " \"Everyone has already covered the basics so here's the highlightsThe audio listening quality is poor especially for 40mm drivers (which normally sound good with strong bass response).  This is due to the fact the speaker itself is far from the ear canal since the outer padding contacts the side of the head instead of the actual speaker pad.The headphones are heavy which means a large amount of pressure is required to hold them in position.  They slide very easily off the head and apply a lot of downward force on the ears.  I have a big head and even made some slight modifications that increase the pressure now they don't slide off but are uncomfortable for more than an hour of use.At first the volume slider is stiff but then becomes smooth.After 4 months of use the mute switch is getting loose I don't expect it to work 4 months from now.I really like the microphone portion of the headset the angle is adjustable and the volume is loud and clear.In the end these headphones have a good microphone matched with very poor quality headphones.  Next time I'd grab the cheaper Logitech headset where they are nice and light and the speaker pads make contact with the ears not some large outer pad \",\n",
       " 'I purchased this unit not for gaming but for making PC to PC calls.  Here are my observationsPros  1. Sound quality of the microphone on the receiving end is reported by my friends and family as exceptionally clear.  Certainly much better than what you\\'d get out of a webcam.2. Chord is robust and long.  Easily fits over my long desk to my CPU that rests beneath.3. Controls are easy to use although the mic on/off switch doesn\\'t click into place like I\\'d expect it to.  It just slides back and forth.  I can see people accidentally turning it off.4. Headphones produce good sound although nothing extraordinary.5. The mic itself freely rotates so you can position it however you desire.Cons1. First and foremost if you\\'ve got a small head DO NOT PURCHASE THIS  My head is not big and these headphones ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE  These headphones are so large that they\\'re actually uncomfortable.  Their entire weight rests on my ears and I can\\'t wear them for very long without my ears falling off.2.  These headphones are very heavy uncomfortably so.  I\\'ve resorted to holding them up to my head and listening through one speaker to take the weight off my ears.3.  Perhaps having the airspace between the speakers and the frame keeps your ears cooler but it still feels like I\\'m wearing a set of insulated ear muffs.  Chatting on hot summer days is limited to 10 minutes or less until I\\'m dying of heat exhaustion.4. You need to get a Y splitter if you wish to have these headphones and your computer speakers on at the same time. If you don\\'t have front headphone plugs on your case this is an issue.  Otherwise you have to crawl under your desk and manually disconnect the headset from your motherboard jacks and plug in your speakers again.  Y splitters are only a few dollars but it\\'s an accessory you will have to purchase especially since front speaker ports on most computers can\\'t be hooked up at the same time as your rear motherboard jack (and most people have their main sound systems plugged in with the rear one). Granted this is more of a general microphone/headset combo issue than anything Logitek related but if this is your first microphone/headset purchase then you should be aware of this problem.  I use onboard audio instead of a sound card so I don\\'t have multiple output jacks.5. These headphones are designed to rest behind your neck not over the top of your head.  Unfortunately the plastic beam is too heavy and pulls the speakers back placing all the weight on your ears.  The plastic beam is also too short (and just) to go over the top of my head for a more comfortable fit. 6. The design also doesn\\'t make sense.  The beam is so short that it should rest behind your neck yet the angle of the speakers through that air gap is better for wearing the beam over your head.  It\\'s pretty uncomfortable.  If the headset was adjustable it would be fine  The earpieces are just too hugeOverall I\\'m disappointed with these.  If you\\'re under 5\\'10\" I say go with another model.

       " \"I have been using the Palmone Navigator with my TX for about eight weeks.  Most of my comments are based on a comparison with the builtin navigation system in my Lexus.  Software installation is fairly easy.  However you need at least a 256 MB SD card to load more than a couple of states I recommend a 1 or 2 GB card.  While the concept of a TX doubling as a navigation device is intriguing the realty of it is rather sobering.  It is a cool toy but if you have to plan routes for your job or any other meaningful purpose this is NOT the right product.  The pros are Inexpensive in comparison to builtins und standalone products Unit can be used in different locations and cars and even while walking One device serves multiple purposesThe cons are It can take up to several minutes after starting the unit to acquire a satellite signal.  This is not the case with my car's OEM navigation system. The maps are outdated and not as precise as the OEM nav system  I live in Phoenix AZ and my neighborhood (built seven years ago) as well as most of the freeways I take to work and back don't exist on the software.  More recent updates are not available (I checked the Tomtom website). Navigation is often not precise enough (e.g. it tells me to make a left in 50 yards when I have already passed the intersection where it wants me to make a left).  I never have this problem with the builtin navigation. Lookup function for addresses and phone numbers is clumsy and doesn't display actual address until you map it. It tends to freeze at least a couple times a day requiring a soft reset.   Lost connections to the satellite receiver or lost satellite signals also tend to disrupt the navigation on longer trips with stops.Overall the unit is too unreliable to be used as your only navigational aid.  If you need navigation to get to your travel destination you are better off with a standalone unit.

To start with the unit is small  the smallest of its kind. But the bulky external mic makes the overall footprint just as large as some of the palmtop units that this was made to replace. Second the unit has a builtin rechargeable battery that cannot be removed. So when it crashes which it does frequently there is no way to \"coldboot\" the unit by removing the battery. This is also a problem because it reduces the unit\\'s true portability because you can easily get stuck with no remaining battery life and no AC power to recharge it. Then what you have is a paperweight. Oh and by the way when you do have it plugged in to charge the backlight is always on (even if the power is off). So forget about using this unit as a plugged in desktop recorder either.But all of this aside the firmware simply does not work. It locks up incessantly and with no way to reboot you literally have to unplug it wait for it to autopoweroff and hope that you can start the machine up again.

My desktop PC's  graphics card went down this past week and I had to RMA it... so about 10 days to send out and get a return.  I have always used a wired connection for my home desktops.  The wireless access was a 'it's there if I need it' novelty.  I started brining my IBM R51 laptop home from work so I could get online VPN into work etc..  This is the first time I have used my wireless consistently for more than a hour or so.The last 10 days have been rediculous to say the least.  I logged on my first day and lost connection 56 times browsing MSN and Yahoo.  At first I thought it might be channel interference since 2 other routers in range were using channel 11.  I went ahead and disabled the 108G feature since I had never come close to hitting that speed anyways and changed the channel..  I used the IBM ThinkVantage software to scan my area for other wireless routers and picked a channel not being used.  I changed channels and I verified my signal strength before and after I changed 95% signal strength. The connection is still getting dropped randomly.  Changed channel to another channel not being used in my area and verified signal strength.  No difference.  Scanned the networks again using the IBM ThinkVantage software.. theres my router 97% signal strength @ 54Mbs.  unplugged router modem repaired my WINSOCKS with WinsockXP rebooted PC.

These are scrawny but on the other hand take up less space. They use a single AAA batt. Using them on the train I was able to turn down the volume on my music player a tad but a lot of the noise still gets through. I'm not an expert on these but I guess this noise cancelling works mainly on lower frequencies. Alot of the noise on the train is higher in pitch and thus gets through. The next thing I noticed was that with a cord coming out of both the left and right earphone you are limited in how you can put these on and take them off. My KOSS and Sony headphones and earbuds use the single cord to one phone and the connecting cord from there (or it runs through the headphone band). I realize I like this single cord feature very much. Again these Philips HN 110 don't have this. I also noticed that when the Noise Cancelling is turned on and the wind is blowing you can hear the wind as if it were amplified.

       " 'Does the unit work??...Well yes to a degree. It takes 6 holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances. The display is poor and though they say \"up to 40 objects per hole\" there is normally 24 objects per hole. All this depends upon the Skycaddie course recorder. The user (you) can not modify the course or add any objects that the  course recorder didn\\'t think was important.Now the bad part. The unit attaches via button and belt clip (like a cell phone). My button (part that attaches to main unit) has died twice in the first 30 days. When it breaks again...which it will often..the unit will probally hit the dirt. This isn\\'t good. But fear not. It will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with Skygolf. And another week to get a replacement button (which has been modified even weaker than the original one). Now my replacement broke on the first time I clipped it to the belt. Now back to Skycaddie to get another. After being on hold for another hour they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts. This will take another hour. You then get a message to leave a message. Normally within a week someone will call you back. By normally I mean about 35% of the time you leave messages they return them. Would I buy another... duh.... NO ',\n",

Did you know the internal components of consumer electronics are connected with tin and nickel?  There's no gold inside  So there's no need for oxygenfree gold tipped multi sheilded super mega supreme cables.   If you don't believe me buy this cable and a noname cheapie.  Compare them for yourself  you will see no difference.With analog signals a good quality cable may make a difference (although the difference is usually only visible on an oscilloscope). \",\n",

Don\\'t get me wrong Monster makes great cables. Let there be no confusion on this point. But they\\'re just incredibly expensive and this is made much worse with these cables.Several people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to errorcorrection and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production) and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future there\\'s really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes the goldplated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit but the improvement will be far less than you\\'d see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.But Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference and that\\'s worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn\\'t just the usual electrical shielding Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn\\'t doubt if they\\'re certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike you\\'re looking at the right cables.But for nearly all consumers these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives with no real plusses. At the very least you can pick up a midgrade cable (Sony etc) at a midgrade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the goldplated connections. And over these products the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean. You\\'ll get much better results with these tools than you will worrying about $100 HDMI cables ',\n",

That's all there is to it. You don't need expensive shielding or gold plated connectors for a cable. The picture or the sound are not richer or more vibrant with a $90 cable over a $10. In fact the signal is identical. Let me repeat  HDMI (&amp DVID) devices talk digitally with error correction. This cable and ones like it are for suckers only. \",\n",

My wife just ran the vacuum and I barely heard it.  The earplug reduced noise feature is great and comfortable however my other ones (Sony earbuds) sound better.

The Idea of having all these \"no ads\" radio stations playing through my car\\'s FM frequency seemed cool.    Setting up the unit and getting it to work was easy. Changing FM frequencies for the wireless transmitter is easy as well. It really is a neat little receiver. However after setting up this unit in my car and the XM2GO in my wife\\'s car I was really disappointed in the music sound quality. The music sounds flat and with a hissy quality almost monaural at times and the volume seems a lot lower than the car\\'s radio at the same volume setting. I had to turn the volume dial up quite a bit when playing satellite radio. The car\\'s regular radio sounds much better than satellite radio if using wireless reception with any of the radio receivers IMO. Besides there are plenty of annoying ads and interruptions on XM radio as someone mentioned in another review.   I thought about having the units professionally installed so that my wife and I wouldn\\'t have to use the poor sounding wireless FM technology but realized that both family cars have very expensive navigation systems and I didn\\'t want the vehicle\\'s factory warranty voided if some installer got inside our car\\'s dash and accidentally messed something up.So about two month\\'s ago after several months of offandon use of XM radio service I called to cancel my subscriptions. I had paid for a six month subscription for both receivers when I joined. As I expected would happen when I called them to cancel I was on the phone for allloooooonnnng time waiting for a customer service rep. Finally I got to tell the rep all my relevant account information so I could cancel the service only to be put on hold and transferred to their \"special\" customer service department for cancellations where I was \"accidentally\" disconnected and had to call back and start all over again.Finally after another long call to them I was able to cancel my service.....or so I thought. Yesterday I was looking at my September credit card bill and saw that XM radio had charged my credit card for the next six months despite the fact that they assured me that my two accounts would be closed. I called my bank and had them reverse the charges and I may have the bank issue me a new credit card with different numbers in case XM tries to charge me again six months from now. ',\n",

The last few times I've taken them out for vacation use in camera I've had the same problem I charge two sets (one Kodak and one these Energizers) when I put the camera away. A few weeks later I go off on vacation. The Kodak 1600mAh set will last me all day on the charge from a month or so before. The Energizer 2500mAh set might last me half a day having lost most of its charge from sitting for the same number weeks before use.After missing out on some pics on my latest trip due to dead batteries I'd had enough. The Energizers are going in the bin and I just followed the good reviews to buy a set of Duracells to replace them. \",\n",

I was upgrading from my previous set of 1600mAh Rayovac NiMH AA batteries that were still going strong after 2 years. When I saw the new energizer 2500mAh rechargeables I was excited to purchase them thinking they would last longer than my old 1600mAh Rayovacs.  Boy was I wrongFor 23 months the 2500mAh energizers worked well. A charge lasted about 67 hours in my portable GPS unit. I was getting roughly 5.56 hours on my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's. My GPS unit is spec'ed for 6 hours on a pair of AA's so the new 2500mAh energizers seemed to work flawlessly.Now they work okay and seem to be getting worse each time I charge them appearing to hold less of a charge each time.  For the last month or two (4th &amp 5th month after their initial purchase) I'll be lucky if I can get 45 hours of use out of them in my portable GPS unit. I now get roughly 3.54 hours of use out of them.  I pulled out and tried my old 1600mAh Rayovac AA's and once again got approximately 5.56 hours of use out of them in my GPS unit  and my trusty Rayovacs are just over 2 years oldI thought I might have had some defective energizers but I can't seem to get any pair of combinations to hold a decent charge. Charges just don't seem to last  it's really disappointing.  I am going to look at another brand for high capacity 2500+ mAh NiMH batteries to replace my 1600mAh Rayovacs. Would be great if the energizer could hold its charge. But because they don't I do not recommend the energizers to anyone \",\n",

       " \"I bought the Zboard and was sorely disappointed in it's playbility efficiency and value for several reasonsThe left buttons which are the feature of the keyboard are based on a mirroring system.  You experience keyboard lag at times because the board has to interpret the button presses based on the zboard program then the game.  I personally had to press some buttons twice or even three times in order for that command to register.The left buttons cannot be configured to your game you must configure the game to it.  The templates for different games cannot be modified all it does is change the button configuration.  There are no patches for configuring the keys to how you want it.According to the website the top buttons for media can only be used with windows media player.  If you use winamp itunes or anything else it wont work.  You cannot program any macros into any of the buttons.  If you are looking for a keyboard that can autofire or program keystrokes this isn't it.   The numpad is configured differently than a normal keyboard.  This can actually be a good thing if you like having a compacted pad.  I found it frustrating since I put attack commands on the numbers and would press the wrong one sometimes because of the layout.I experienced a lot of frustration with this controller while pvping in world of warcraft.  The top buttons on the left side of the board give you access to a bigger arsenal of spells and abilities when programmed right.  The problem is remembering how zboard configured the button layout.  I would constantly get wailed on because a button wasn't where I originally remembered it to be.  This forced me to sit in the key bindings menu to configure the buttons to where I could remember.  After completely revamping my bindings I gave up restored my defaults and used a regular keyboard instead.There is nothing gaming enhancing about this keyboard beyond having an accessory on the left side that looks cool because the buttons are grey and red and contoured to your hand.  To achieve the same effect as the zboard turn your current keyboard slightly to the right and enjoy. \",\n",

       " 'I logged 870 miles with the iway 350.  270 miles around maryland it was / is a great item. I took it on our first trip to New York and Long Island and it was terrible. The first problem occurred on the New Jersey turnpike. I was supposed to use the turnpike from start to exit 18 and at exit 4 we stopped to eat. The unit said I was off course because the rest area was 100 feet from the highway. However when we returned to the highway the unit could not chart the course any more. It said I was doing 95 miles a hour when i was doing 70 and it would lose satellites and go searching for them in the middle of the highway no obstructions of any kind anywhere. I even pulled over at exit 6 and we waited for 20 minutes to see if we just needed to stop the car for it to do the job. It did not recalculate our course until after exit 18 some 100 + miles from when it acted up. We even tried a full restart and cancel route and retried again from the address book and from direct typing the information again. About 1 mile from our destination it worked for 2 blocks and was lost again. Then after 2 more blocks we found where we where going. We often get lost on this trip this is why we purchased the unit. Then on the trip from the Bronx to Long Island a 30 mile trip it stopped 5 blocks into the journey and was recalculating. I had to call the people we where visiting and they directed us by phone. However about 1 mile from their place it started working again. We used it on long island with no trouble at all. Then on  trip back to the Bronx it worked pretty good only losing its position once on a major highway no trees or obstructions. Then on our way back from the Bronx to long Island it was lost half the way finding position and calculating . The same exact way we went in both directions but it was clearly not right leaving the Bronx. On our way back to Maryland it operated pretty good after a short stretch of lost signals and redirecting and we used exactly the same roads in both directions. I did update the software to the new 1.2.0 days before we took the trip.  Also charting the 212 mile course to the Bronx NY took close to 20 minutes then the extra destination to Long Island a 30 mile addition took the Iway 350 30 or so more minutes. I figured with all that time the trip home calculations would be faster but I fell asleep after waiting  over a hour for it to complete the task. I feel this is one issue the unit has. Longer trips take so long to calculate so when it thinks your off track it takes forever to chart a new course. On short runs under 20 miles it was very fast.I returned the unit and got a Garmin C530. The C530 is a very nice unit fast in every respect. ',\n",

Four of the eleven lost episodes were because newly constructed highways were not recognized. Five were due to the unit reacting too slowly in rapid turning sequences.

I have kept my eye on Tivo for some time and when my DVR box went out for the 2nd time I decided it was time to try Tivo.  I got a refurbished Series2 DVR that was free for signing a 1 yr commitment for $12.95 per month. I received the Tivo only 2 days after I ordered very impressive since I didn\\'t pay to have it shipped that quickly.  The setup was reasonably straight forward.  I had heard so much about Tivo that I had very high expectations and here are the problems I encountered that surprised me1)  My first mistake was not recognizing that you have to get a Dual tuner unit to be able to record 2 seperate programs (DVR does this automatically).  So I ordered the wrong unit.  To be honest I don\\'t see how this service is very useful at all with only a single tuner my family relies on dual tuners A LOT.  I am shocked that Tivo even offers a single tuner system to me it\\'s like a tricycle compared to a 10 speed a dual tuner is so much more useful.  2)  I thought I would be able to hook up a wireless receiver to connect to my home network.  No you have to buy theirs for $40 to $50.  Since I didn\\'t know that I had to rely on the phone line option.  This really stinks it is very very very slow.  I spent 2 hrs trying to download one days programming the system kept getting interuppted during download (yes I disabled call waiting).  3)  When you use the online program guide it covers up the entire screen.  My Cox DVR puts the TV in upper right corner (approx. 1/4) asnd the rest of the screen lets you see the guide.  We use this all of the time to see if there is anything better on but that won\\'t work so well with Tivo.  Plus scrolling up and down is painfully slow the screen takes for ever to refresh.4)  Similarly to item 3 above when you review recorded programs the show you are watching is turned off completely you can only see the Tivo guide.  Again Cox DVR lets me look at my list and delete files etc.. all while my TV program stays visible in the upper right corner.  5)  Remote wouldn\\'t work with my 42\" Akai plasma.

I had also hoped I could use it as a simple player to download affirmations and such to listen to throughout the day. This it won't do and it was not clear to me from the information here and on the Olympus site that it would not function this way.First even though it records wav files it does not let you handle them well at all. To transfer recordings to your computer you have to install special software (included) but you cannot transfer wav files back to the recorder (according to the software guide). If you want a recorder/player to function easily like that you should go for the more expensive ones that allow you to use them as a USB flash drive (like the Creative Zen series). I did not install the software as it offered nothing other than the simple transfer of a recording to my computer. I can record directly to the PC with much higher quality so why bother? Noise recorded in a high quality format is still noise. It makes more sense to simply repeat anything I record on the Olympus and record it directly to the PC.Second the sound quality is not great. Given that wav files are what are used on CDs one would expect more than what this device delivers. It is noisy on either of the mic settings and I would have to describe the sound quality as medium. Don't expect high fidelity. This is a voice recorder for recording quick notes and not much else. Even analog tape would be better for most things. I may be fussier than most about this having some professional background in audio so the sound quality may be okay for most people. People have gotten used to lower standards in just about everything.Finally playback was very disappointing to me. It has only the simplest playback features. It plays pauses fast forwards and reverses period. You cannot repeat either a single recording or portion of one and you cannot create any kind of list to specify only certain files to play. It plays (manually) one recording at a time and that is it. You cannot set markers to fast forward or reverse to (like chapters on a DVD) and searching through a recording of any length is a major pain. In fact this recorder is defined more by what it cannot do than what it can do. It is well built physically although it is definitely designed for small hands and can be a bit uncomfortable to use if your hands aren't small.If all you want is to record medium quality voice this will work fine. Don't expect it to record music or anything like that  you will be disappointed. Think of it as the audio version of a $20 digital camera. Cheap quick grabs the image but no frills at all. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed. I am usually very happy with Olympus gear but this is definitely below their usual standard. Unless your needs are very spartan and smple I would recommend looking at more capable devices \",\n",

       " '1.  Buttons are too small some of which are not spaced apart very well (very convenient for somebody waking up who can accidentally hit the wrong button).2.  Buttons are labeled organized and layed out confusingly.  For example why not have an \"alarm interface\" which would include all of the alarm modes and features and maybe a \"radio interface\" which would include all of the radio functions/settings.  You would really understand how confusing this is if you were to actually go through the process of operating this alarm clock.  But really don\\'t do it make the smart choice.3.  Too many features/modes.  I understand some people prefer all of the different features but I wanted a simple alarm clock with a buzzer/radio and clock.  Of course all of these special modes are set as the default so it is a pain to try and configure all of the settings to a simple mode.  So for those who want a simple alarm clock definitely DO NOT GET THIS4.  The button handling event is flawed.  For example sometimes when I push a button it does not handle the event (the device doesn\\'t think that you pressed the button).  So I would have to press the button again and check to see if the radio handled the button input correctly.5.  It is very slow when holding the button down and waiting for the alarm clock to increment up and down.6.  Radio reception is very poor.  I have another radio right next to it that gets much better reception than this clock.7.

This time Escort Radar told me \"if you leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter over night this has been found to cause problems.\" Well my lighter power goes off when I turn off the ignition so this doesn\\'t apply. Escort Radar also told me that \"excessive heat\" has been causing them problems. Now we have had a few days of 100ï¿½ heat and I\\'m sure the car gets hotter parked in the sun but the design engineers should have accounted for these conditions plus some margin when you design something that is supposed to work in a car.

But they\\'re just incredibly expensive and this is made much worse with these cables.Several people have pointed out that the digital signal on HDMI cables must adhere to errorcorrection and certain standards (even a $10 cable cable must meet some specifications to even reach production) and this is largely true. Unless BluRay implements new features that require new cables at some point in the future there\\'s really very little difference between HDMI cables. Yes the goldplated pins and other features will improve your connection a bit but the improvement will be far less than you\\'d see between any other \"cheap\" versus \"designer\" cables on the market.But Monster cables really are made to a standard that makes some difference and that\\'s worth mentioning. This cable is built sturdy so that none but the most harsh of treatment could ever damage it. And the shielding isn\\'t just the usual electrical shielding Monster cables are toughened to the point that I wouldn\\'t doubt if they\\'re certified against nuclear fallout. If you have the money to blow and you want the confidence of knowing that your entertainment center could fare well in an EMP strike you\\'re looking at the right cables.But for nearly all consumers these cables cost 4x as much as alternatives with no real plusses. At the very least you can pick up a midgrade cable (Sony etc) at a midgrade price ($40) to get the increased sturdiness and the goldplated connections. And over these products the Monster cables basically have nothing at all except their branding. Please do look up a cheaper alternative this time and spend some of the extra money on an extra set of whatever tools you use to keep your screen clean.

This is nice if you are out and running around and your charge goes down simply buy 3 AA alkaline batteries and go on your way.  There is no problem if you forget you have the NORMAL NONRECHARGABLE AA batteries in the case if you put it in the charging stand.  Unlike other units the physical metal conductors to charge the battery pack are actually built into the pack not the handset.  If you put it batteries the charger makes no connection to the handset. If you put in the rechargable battery pack 2 silver contacts from the battery pack  contact the charging stand and VOILA the unit charges.  Fitting the handset into the recharger is a nightmare though  It must be generic and able to fit several different Motorola products (production outsourced to Giant Int\\'l Ltdso if you thought this was a genuine Motorola built item you are mistaken.  The entire Talkabout line are outsourced for production) as the dualcompartment charger has 2 inserts in each compartment and no indication of which one to use for the T6500R\\'s.  I am a smart person though so I chose the one that looked like it best fit and inserted it.  Then I attempted to insert the T6500R\\'s.  I say attempted because the bottom of the handset is rounded and thus does not seat well in any direction.  After you get it to EXACTLY the right position (look on the charger to watch for the LED to light up) the the hard part (of charging that is) is over.Next item Bad red LCD backed screen.  Hard to read in ANY light and impossible in the sunlight.  Settings were easy enough.  Channel subchannel vibrate NOAA broadcasts etc.  However the advertised QT (ensures no one can talk through your handset unless they are using a compatible Motorola handset) does not work unless you hit the PTT (push to talk) button (or the CALL button) wait about 3 seconds and begin speaking.  My inlaws are new to technology and are used to experiencing walkietalkies when their kids were young.  Therefore this is unusual.  They automatically want to push the button and talk.  So the first part of what they say is immediately lost. I say \"first part\".  I am assuming I actually caught a portion of what they said.  This brings me to the second major flaw.  This unit contains a HORRIBLE speaker.  If the volume is too low then you can\\'t hear it.  Too high and it is garbled beyond your ability to understand it.  We were really hardpressed to find a happy medium.  AND in a noisy room it would\\'ve been impossible to hear anything.Some merchants list these as 5 mile radios.  The packaging says 10.  The 1 watt GMRS suggests about 510.  We got less than 1.  Directly over a lake. In vehicles on the I5 we drove less than 2 miles from their house  (which is DIRECTLY ON the interstate) and got no signal.  I got back to my house in San Jose (on top of Communications Hill...the largest \"hill\" in the area) and could not communicate to my spouse less than 1/2 mile away while he was coming up our roadSince the weekend I have spent all my extra time on Amazon.com and Consumer Reports reviewing all the offerings.  (the latter Consumer Reports\\' reviews are from July in 2002) So I think I am going to return these and purchase the Midland 5 watt GXT500\\'s from Amazon.  Remember doubling the wattage (in this case MORE than doubling) does not give double the signal.  As another others have stated increasing wattage increases only another portion of the distanceie 2 watts to 4 watts does NOT double the distance the signal can reach.)Hope this reveiw helps you ',\n",

       " \"When realtime traffic monitoring came to my city I immediately started looking at solutions to help my wife's daily business driving (2500 miles weekly crisscrossing a 50mile area through major traffic routes). I quickly settled on an automotive GPS with realtime traffic monitoring. There are not yet many choices in this area so the options boiled down to this unit and the Garmin 2720. (These use FM radio for the traffic info the XMradio units like the TomTom 700 and Garmin 2730 had unacceptably high monthly costs since I don't want XM radio.)I chose the Cobra for its large screen and positive reviews in areas that were important to me. Its flawed routing ability was not a major issue as it was to be used in a wellknown region. Address lookup and traffic monitoring were the primary needs.In short I don't know much about how the Cobra performs because I was only able to use it for a few short test trips. This is because the mounting hardware is one of the most deficient pieces of engineering I have ever encountered in higherend electronics gear The only mounting option is via suction cup which in tests would adhere reliably only to nearly flat glass. A stickon disc for attaching the suction cup is also provided but I did not attempt to use it and would not trust it to be able to hold this heavy (1.25 pound) unit over the long run. If your vehicle does not have a flat section of windshield in a convenient location you will have very few options for mounting this unit. California law prohibits attaching things to the windshield meaning that California users either need to risk a minor ticket or find an acceptable alternate mounting point. (Good luck to you I was unable to find one in three different vehicles) Compounding the problem is that the mount has a very limited positioning range and easily runs out of adjustment room for most potential mounting alternatives. Cobra does not offer any other mounts or mounting accessories at all  no beanbag or friction mount no clamp no fixedbase mount nothing. If there is any aftermarket option (RAM Mount etc.) I was unable to find it. You are stuck with Cobra's proprietary mount unless you are willing to modify the unit or its mounting pieces and fabricate an adapter for a Garmin or RAM Mount base.I was *almost* willing to go the extra mile to make this unit work in my vehicle even though the best solution would have been very awkward to dismount and remount making it a potential theft target.The final straw was when I found that the traffic receiver was faulty and I was unable to get a reply from the manufacturer in a timely manner (two days now and counting...) Enough's enough something was telling me that this unit wasn't the right choice.So this unit is being returned and I've already ordered a Garmin 2720 with GTM11 traffic receiver in replacement. The prices for the units through Amazon are nearly the same (especially when factoring in the costs for 15 months of traffic monitoring  the Cobra comes with three months and gets $60 per year after that while the Garmin comes with 15 months and has the same annual cost after that  so you have to add $60 to the Cobra to get a truly equivalent price). Garmin also has excellent mounts with a range of attachment options some of the best map and routing tools and a long track record with GPS units. It does have a smaller screen and some complaints about the user interface but at least I can mount it properly and be able to tuck it away and remount it easily to prevent theft.This unit gets two stars only because my brief experience with its function appears to live up to all the positive reviews  but overall it's like a highperformance sports car with no wheels I 100% recommend against it for California users and suggest that others try to lay hands on a sample unit to see if it can be properly mounted in your vehicle before laying out $750 \",\n",

Imagine listening to the first movement of Swan Lake followed immediately by something from 9 Inch Nails then maybe a Bach Cantata. Using Media Player to sync did no better.  Creating a playlist (m3u) of 82 files and then syncing did exactly the same as drag and drop.  A hopeless mess no play order missing files and so on.  After spending 3 hours with SanDisk tech support we were both more than ready to quit.  The tech had no more idea that I did about how to solve the problems that plagued the player and we both gave it up as a bad job.This is little machine has plenty going for it in the specification but it\\'s hopelessly flawed in the implementation and this is without complaining about the stiff control wheel or the overly small buttons.  Throughly frustrated it was in the mail being returned less than 8 hours after I received it.  I just cannot recommend this player it needs a through overhaul of the interface and firmware and fixing the control wheel and buttons would be a plus as well.  As it stands it\\'s without merit as a player.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t ',\n",
       " 'I had high expectations for this product having bought some of Sandisk\\'s other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn\\'t give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped. It would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes instead Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. \"It\\'s our way or the highway.\" Once one masters creating playlists they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.It\\'s too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other previous Sandisk products). Well you can but it won\\'t make much difference if the device won\\'t play. ',\n",

However tracking is a nightmare  especially when CPU usage is high (applications like Photoshop Acrobat or using a VPN to access my work files).

That means that every time I want to use the headset I need to fumble around at the back of the unit to switch wires. The volume of both ingoing and outgoing conversation is very low  even when I turn up the volume controls to max. The people I spoke with complained enough that I switched back to my regular handset. The microphone although it's somewhat adjustable is short and inflexible enough that I can't get it very close enough to my mouth. When I try to move it closer the earpiece turns and slips off my ear. The headset itself  that is the plastic adjustable arch and rubber pad opposite the speaker  is very awkward and prone to slipping off my head. It might have been better to design it like a regular twosided earphone unit  so that it would be more balanced and stay secure.I don't know whether these comments apply only to the S11 or to most headsets for traditional phones in general.Overall however if I'd been buying the S11 with my own money I would likely have returned it and just gone back to using the regular phone handset \",\n",

I am a software developer  I have half a dozen computers at home  and I did everything as instructed. I found the software to be very average in terms of usability (why do they try to do all these fancy effects??) but that's not very important when it works fine. Unfortunately after just a couple of days the keyboard stopped working. I finally managed to get it back by removing the batteries and rebooting the computer (both step were required  the on/off switch didn't work  same thing for the connect button which is totally ineffective). Now the mouse keeps on dropping connections. After a couple of hours of inactivity the mouse simply stops responding.This is simply unacceptable. Logitech knows that this product doesn't work and keeps on charging customers for something that is simply not usable because it wasn't tested properly.It is a very frustrating experience because the hardware is great.

Here is my experience1) It took about 2 months and about 2 hours on the phone for them to switch my existing phone  over to Vonage.  Don\\'t be too excited about getting the first month free if your moving an existing number it will take about that long to get it switched over.2) After my number was finally switched over outgoing calls were constantly being dropped after about 2030 seconds.  Incoming calls would also be dropped occasionally after about a minute.  This resulted in having to call the person back saying \"sorry the call was dropped we switched to this cheaper phone service and have been having problems....\"This is with the highest speed cable internet service available (8mbps download 600kbps upload) and a wireless \\'g\\' system which has provided top notch internet service consistently while I had Vonage problems.  I spent no less than 4  5 calls and over 5 hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix the problem.  After talking with tech support sometimes the problem would be fixed temporarily while I was on the phone with them but return shortly thereafter.3) As a result of the problems I had I asked to be credited for the months in which my phone service was not working.  Be warned they are very hardnosed about providing any credits for poor or no service.  I spoke to a tech support person about getting a credit for a month of no service and he told me to wait until the problem had been fixed so they could determine how much credit should be given.  After the problem had been fixed (temporarily) I called back and they told me they could only provide credit for the current month not previous months of no or poor service.  THEY ARE NOT CUSTOMER FRIENDLY ABOUT PROVIDING REFUNDS FOR POOR OR NO SERVICE.4) Finally in September still with dropped calls from Vonage I switched back to Qwest to get reliable phone service.  I found customer service there has improved and is much better than Vonage.  And they gave me 3 months free promotion for coming back.  In the end I am happy to pay the extra $10/month (after the first 3 months free) to get phone service that works.  I notice that $5 of the extra cost is for fees etc. that the phone company has to charge but Vonage does not which is unfortunate.  In any case I guess you get what you pay for.One last thing Vonage has never made a profit and many business analysts say with their current business plan they never will.

I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line).  I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.  Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes.  It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop).  The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard).

The product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot.  But what a surprise.   Just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price.  The pop-up menu thing is cool.  I don\\'t use it as much for putting tools, but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place.   I guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around, but I don\\'t seem to use that as much.

Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable.  I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.\\n\\nThe picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I\\'m very happy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMy new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.\\n\\nMy cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\\n\\nThe quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.\\n\\nSet-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\\n\\nAll in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nSo, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn\\'t work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn\\'t find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn\\'t matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It\\'s not a night-and-day difference, but it\\'s a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \\nThis product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it\\'s control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I\\'ll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \\n\\nMy recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it\\'s not an option and you don\\'t want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it\\'s biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an \"ABC\" book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNice sound, I will admitt for the price, I get big sound, with quality.  Only thing is a humming, hissing sound when machine is idle. Ohtherwise, worth it. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you \"must\" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt\\'s a simple device, so there\\'s not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue).\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this TV for college, and it fits perfectly in my dorm. The picture quality is pretty decent, though compared to traditional TV, it is not as sharp.\\n\\nThe audio quality is very good. I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations.\\n\\nNo lag while playing my Playstation 2 console...\\n\\nThe only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press \"SOURCE\" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it\\'s annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it\\'s a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe used this charger with a DC inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a Sony DSC-H5 camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges. The 2700mAh battery is great\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I\\'m drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I\\'ve heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFabulous product --- now I can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range.    Happy I purchased this one -- very trouble free\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI wouldn\\'t be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn\\'t have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That\\'s all there is to it, that\\'s what it does and it does it well. \\n\\nOn the down side, and it\\'s a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you\\'d sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don\\'t like the attachment to the neck strap, I don\\'t like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\\n\\nI use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don\\'t have an issue. \\n\\nIf Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it\\'s a bit lacking here\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of Memorex and so far I have not had any problems. They work just fine on my Sony dvd burner\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMemorex DVD+R\\'s are the best. Price keeps dropping and never have a problem\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months, I have only had 1 burn badly.  Haven\\'t found a dvd player yet that they won\\'t play in\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is an excellent machine.  I bought two of them.  There are a few things you need to do.  I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVD-R up to 8x.  I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\\n\\nOne of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\\n\\nGet one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made!  Throw away your VCRs forever!  Just remember to baby them\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I\\'m sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can\\'t go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn\\'t seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.  Because of that, I\\'m still going to give it a full 5 stars..it\\'s not as if those 2 whole minutes ruined our life.  Really, if you\\'re new to this technology, you\\'re not going to have any problems..believe me..A++\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe other effusive reviews are spot-on...  the picture is fabulous on new DVDs (Lord of the Rings, Nemo, Harry Potter).  A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42\" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that\\'s not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I\\'m sure there\\'s a solution, but just can\\'t figure it out.  Any tips\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVHS to DVD disc is just one easy setup. I set mine to record and recode just before I go to sleep. When I wake up a finished disc awaits. With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well. IPOD old music videos and movies for a real treat. Sound is perfect\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve had this photo printer a few weeks now.

I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).\\n\\nPLUSES: \\ndecent sound\\ngood functionality\\neasy set-up and intuitive operation\\nsimple remote -- but only covers basic functions\\n\\nCONS:\\nvery short speaker leads\\nunattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox\\nonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units\\n\\nAt first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can\\'t expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven\\'t blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.\\n\\nI originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn\\'t have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nA memory Stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a Sony Camera - Fantastic\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis portable cd holder is perfect for me.  I work out regularly and it has been perfect for the gym.  My cd player fit fine and there are 3 slots for extra cd\\'s.  I like the feature of the headphones attaching to the outside of the pouch.  I would recommend it to anyone\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\n(Note to Brian: The WAP54G *can* be configured as a bridge. I have two of them in just such a configuration. Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)\\n\\nMajor modes of operation are:\\n\\n1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up)\\n2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)\\n3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)\\n4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a \"virtual\" cable; you need two to get the job done)\\n\\nA pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian\\'s comment that this wouldn\\'t work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.\\n\\nI rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.\\n\\n1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment!\\n2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well, it\\'s not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.\\n3. Something that 99% of the world won\\'t care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it\\'s attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\ni love the mobilemate sd.  I haven\\'t had any problems yet.

I would buy Kingston again\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe first peron to review this incorrectly stated that it doesn\\'t come with software for handhleds. That person chose to buy it without and save some $$ and then complained about having to pay extra for it because he/she bought the wrong software package.  Delorme did the right thing and offered us options.  I just ordered mine and I have no plans on using with a HH so I\\'m very happy that I didn\\'t have to buy the HH software.  Just don\\'t be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it.  Nemerous people have highly recommended this to me, although I have heard that MS Mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option.  Storing 50,000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome.  I will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route, elevation, etc.  Too bad it is only in Yellow..\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this jacket a month into having my ipod.  I had to buy it because I had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when I pulled the iPod out of that case it was easy to drop.  One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs.\\n\\nThis case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine.  My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out.  It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction.  Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface.\\n\\nIt will protect your pod though\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe product works perfectly.  The only problem is, the manual only includes directions for the most common setups.  To use one port as an \"uplink\" to a router, for example, you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled \"1\" and then leave port \"2\" open.  The directions do not state this, and I had to call Linksys to get it to work.\\n\\nOther than that, it is fast, reliable, and small.  Perfect\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMy setup:\\n- Dell Latitude PP01L (Intel chip)\\n- Win XP Pro\\n- D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router (with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna)\\n- Enabled the WEP feature\\n\\nI unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in.  Windows found the new card and did its Plug-n-Play thing.  Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately, but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn\\'t \\'see\\' with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card.  This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers.\\n\\nThe CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D-Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up-to-date.  I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D-Link card. I\\'ve never had a problem with D-Link\\'s website (or customer service, while we\\'re on the subject), so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D-Link\\'s site.  \\n\\nEither way...  install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates.\\n\\nBe sure to enable the encryption feature.  If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can\\'t go snooping through your stuff.  Or worse, lift the signal, and ultimately your personal information.\\n\\nI\\'ve had no problems with my current set-up.  I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop up-to-date\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. \\nThe cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. \\n\\nIn short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it. It had gotten very good reviews. Ive ben playing with it for about a month now and i find it meets all my needs and then some.

I would definitely recommend it.\\nThe DPI adjustment is a nice touch.  I prefer corded mice due to cordless being to heavy, this mouse is just right\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor those of you who bought MiniDisc recorders to move away from analog tape recording, this product is wonderful.  Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc.  It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one.\\n\\nOne of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section.\\n\\nI record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station\\'s tape deck to my iRiver.\\n\\nFor those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it\\'s a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before -- you can\\'t change it on the fly.\\n\\nI\\'ve recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on.  Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.\\n\\nI\\'ve also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I\\'m still refining with later iRiver products.\\n\\nThe single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved!\\n\\nThe negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive.\\n\\nFiles are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don\\'t know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can\\'t trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don\\'t think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.\\n\\nAlso, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.\\n\\nI\\'ve had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I\\'m only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses, it\\'s starting to wear out.  But it\\'s still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.\\n\\nI have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it.  Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.\\n\\nI\\'m quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this for hubby and me over the summer.   We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it.   WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor.  We had not problems whatsoever, in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter.   \\nI did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next, but i don\\'t think anybody can improve upon that.  I had the same problem w/ my itrip.  \\nWe chose sirius for several reasons...i liked the classic vinyl station, my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007.\\nThe only problem i had was i couldn\\'t read the red lettering in the daylight w/ the sunglasses on, but i didn\\'t give them less than 5 stars because of this.  \\nthis is the way to go, plus it has a suction mount, not a permanent mount. \\nalso, if you look on ebay, someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat!!\\ndefinitely go satellite, the music is great and little/ no commercials depending on the stations.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWorks good, small, and comes with handy little stickers to put on so you can write contact info in case you lose it, though slightly costl\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this hub back in September.

In RAW mode, which I\\'m converting to thanks to this large capacity card, I am able to hold 444 images all on my 20D!!! If your thinking of buying this card, don\\'t hesitate.

Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can\\'t seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It\\'s actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It\\'s actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can\\'t except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAfter having two SanDisk card readers, and one LaCie card reader die on me, I invested in this Lexar card reader. For the money, it has worked flawlessy with Pro compact flash cards up to 4GB in size. I am very impressed with the transfer speeds, and the unit is not too big for traveling. The door that covers the slot, however, is very flimsy and easily deattaches (but fortunately easily reattaches too?) I use Mac OS X 10.4.8 and it works just fine. I also used it with Windows XP without any installation or transfer issues\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nA simple, cheap investment.  This CF reader actually does what it should, i.e. transfer info from compact flash to the computer.

The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).\\n\\nThe Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis was the least expensive 1 GB memory card I have ever seen and it works as well as it should\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \\n\\nThe variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \\n\\nThe only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don\\'t need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can\\'t say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won\\'t regret it.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nGreat for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your Ipo\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Memorex DVD+R 16x discs are great.

Well, I thought that those marks would disappear after I used the repair paste with the yellow circles, but they\\'re still there. Is it supposed to be like this? The reason I bought the thing was to make the cds look like new, but now they just look even more scratched with the buffer marks all over.\\n\\nCould someone answer this question for me please\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWith boys aged 2 &amp; 3, and some poor disc storage procedures when I\\'m driving, it appeared I was in need of one of these units.  Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn\\'t take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children\\'s cds in the car I don\\'t always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I\\'m very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \\n\\nThis product repairs a disc to \"useable\" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It\\'s also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \\n\\nI agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nSo far I havent filled up my disc yet using it.

THIS IS NOT TRUE if you\\'re carefull.  First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries.  Pretty simple, huh?  Also, don\\'t wait for your battery to completely die before you change it.

If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go, then you\\'ve found the right radio for you.  I can\\'t tell you how many pieces of junk I\\'ve bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50\\'s and 60\\'s--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don\\'t think you have a choice but to pick up this radio\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nSound great.

That normally doesn\\'t matter if you choose a good empty frequency, but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect. \\n\\nNext, I can\\'t turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.\\n\\nLast, the most annoying part of this whole product, is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use. I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back, as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.\\n\\nSince my car doesn\\'t leave me many options for stereo replacement, this is the best product for my specific situation, though I may try and get that old one back from my friend...maybe an \"upgrade\" to a newer one will settle the deal\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nYou must have received CA-709 (without the cassette component) by mistake.

It was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units.  I am satisfied with the product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...\\n\\nI could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.\\n\\nTons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  \\n\\nReally easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.\\n\\nDid I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.\\n\\nBest of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.\\n\\nThe end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis item does exactly what it\\'s suppose to do. It also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception. Worth the money. Only drawback would be, there is a lot of cord hanging around\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Sony SS-MF650H are a low-cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.\\n\\nThough I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.\\n\\nThe sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don\\'t get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\\n\\nThe bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don\\'t worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won\\'t suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\\n\\nIgnore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\\n\\nYou get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\\n\\nI would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you\\'re willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.\\n\\nI also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you\\'re looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI listen to a wide range of music, from hard rock, techno/electronic, to classical, and I\\'ve found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this -- at least until I ordered this set.  I was apprehensive about buying online (and also about the Sony brand for speakers), but I\\'m very happy with this purchase.  I\\'ve been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course, this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I\\'d definitely recommend this speaker set\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis first time I use the HD product in my home video system and have the expected results.

What is not made clear at the time of purchase is that you will need a bridge or gaming adapter as well as a high speed internet connection at home.  The adapter should be built into the box. \\nAnother disappointing factor is that the quality of the video is almost unwatchable if the connection is not robust.  There should be a cache memory built in so that a clear, unchoppy video and sound come through.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nOne of the best gadget-products I\\'ve ever bought.

In fact, it has more volume, depth, and presence than three other portable speakers--each costing 50 to 75% more--to which I\\'ve compared it.  The only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage-free from Amazon, diminishing its \"bargain\" appeal somewhat.)\\n\\nThese modest-sized and priced speakers perform as advertised: the sound is more than adequate; they\\'re small enough that I can take The Stephen Colbert Report  with me on walks; when not in use, they fold up into a mini Porta-John.

Here are the aspects people always want to know about:\\n\\nBASS: these don\\'t pound your eardrums in, but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I\\'ve heard.  You can really follow the bass line with these, rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration.\\n\\nMIDS/HIGHS: this is the reason to buy these headphones.  Not too bright, but very clear, warm, smooth, soothing, and musical.  The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I\\'d never heard before on that song.  In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones.\\n\\nThese obviously can\\'t play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don\\'t think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.

I\\'m glad I did. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI think this is as good as the expensive over $60 HDMI cables.  I wouldn\\'t spend money on the expensive ones.  First of all, I\\'m not a cable junkie nor an expert.  However, according to my research, there\\'s no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it\\'s all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones.  The durability of the cables... I don\\'t know.  But unless you\\'re someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn\\'t matter.  Normally, you\\'d connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones.  I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85.  Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same.  Don\\'t buy the expensive ones\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot.

(disclaimer: I am not an audio professional, nor do I have any expensive headphones to compare with.)\\n\\nThey have great detail in both low and high end. In fact, I can hear things in some of my music that I never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam on-ear style or earbud styles.  This is good when listening to original CDs, or HQ mp3/AAC, but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that I had just not heard before...\\n\\nI tested these with a frequency response program on my Mac, show as having 25-15,600 Hz (in my ears, your ears may vary...) .  This range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds.\\n\\nThey do a good job of blocking out external noises-- great if you are in a bit of a noisy space.\\n\\nAnd, yes, they were a bit tight on the head initially.  To fix that, I got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches (pun intended). This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.  NOTE: this procedure is at your own risk, as I do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg.  ;-)   Do not overstretch them, as the headband material, while flexible, undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take.\\n\\nGreat Bargain Headphones\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNot an audiophile, but someone looking to spend a decent amount of money on a quality set of headphones.

The size of this USB drive and the fact that you\\'ll never have to worry about losing the cap along with an excellent price make it worth buying. After you uninstall the U3 software, it works like any other drive.

Brilliant...\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought these headphones a week ago and I am very pleased with them. At the electronic store, I listen to 3 pairs of Sennheiser (HD-433 ; HD-437 and HD-457). I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\\nI do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\\nOverall, I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\\nWhen it comes to music, I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\\nVery good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong.

Priced right, I\\'m glad I purchased.  Received it on time.  Totally happy with my purchase.  \\n\\nMy only wish is that it came with a case and a neck or wrist strap.  It\\'s so small it gets tossed into whatever pocket is available and that can lead to scratches from keys, etc\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am a success coach and I record all my coaching calls as a standard practice. This recorder has performed fantastically in all situations. I get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation (depending on battery quality) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls (I have an adapter for the phone). I have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results. I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won\\'t miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it\\'s always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use.

This Apple 20\" is very close in spec to my iMac 20\" screen. Stores like Best Buy do not have good quality 20+\" LCDs in yet. You want the 16x9 profile also, the regular square LCDs look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios. The newer stuff is very bright and clear. It is obvious when you go to a store and look at the LCD screens. The cheap $200 LCDs just don\\'t look good in comparison to the new stuff.\\n\\nIntel iMac screen:\\n1680x1050\\n280 cd/m2 (brightness in candle power)\\n800:1 Contrast ratio\\n\\nApple 20\" LCD\\n1680x1050\\n250 cd/m2  \\n400:1 Contrast\\n14ms response time (www.apple.com/displays/specs.html)\\n\\nOther comparables:\\nGateway 21\" 1680x1050 $599\\n300 cd/m2  1000:1 contrast\\n\\nDell 24\" 2405FPW $800\\n1920 x 1200\\n500 cd/m2\\n1000:1 contrast\\n\\nYou should be aiming for at least 300 cd/m2 on brightness and close to 1000:1 contrast.  These Apple LCDs have been out for awhile and are starting to show their age in comparison to the brand new products that have just started to come out. If you are using your LCD for a TV you may need the brightness, but for computer work the Mac 20\" LCD is just about right. \\n\\nI paid a few $$$ more ($750 total price) for the Apple LCD, but I feel I made the correct purchase. I just didn\\'t like the way the others looked and it had to look good against my iMac.

The process has been slow mainly because of the price and availability of Apple products:  High and Scarce.\\n\\nThe best thing about Apple is that their customer forums are full of people like you and me, and if you have a problem, someone else has most likely had it, too.  Those forums helped in my decision to purchase this monitor.\\n\\nI had been looking closely at the 23\" monitor.  When I read about a majority of the displays getting a pink tint after only a few hours of use, I realized I would either wait until Apple re-engineered the monitor, or look at other options.\\n\\nWith the 20\" Aluminum, I didn\\'t have to look far.

A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe recently purchased 4 of these phones and all of them work fine. The CID works perfectly for both lines. The interface/menu takes a few minutes to learn and get used to but I wouldn\\'t call it \"non-intuitive\".\\n\\nThe Redial button (as you can see in the picture) is right above the number pad. If you can\\'t find it, you might want to buy a phone with less buttons and less features. And it\\'s pretty simple to redial a number in the CID display... when you see/get to the number press Enter twice (Once to bring up the \"MENU\", and Once more to \"DIAL\"). In fact you can also save that number into the phone\\'s memory through the menu (press Enter once and scroll through the options)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAt first, I was not sure about if this Windshield Mounting Bracket was going to stay in place while I drive trough the streets. However, I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another, even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment, and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise.\\n\\nPros: Strong suction rubber system, GPS mounting system\\nCons: Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane, so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that\\'s why I give 4 stars\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVery strong suction cup provides secure mounting. Quick and easy clip in and release for taking the GPS with you. Product would be better if the pivoting arms were longer and able to swivel sideways.

Amazon\\'s description for the height at 2.5\" is incorrect, according to Panasonic\\'s website. Should be listed as 3 9/32\"H. Makes a difference if you\\'re short on space\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was paranoid about having buyer\\'s remorse from this unit. For such a cheap price I was sure I would end up regretting the purchase. What is the tradeoff? Shoot if know, but I haven\\'t regretted buying it one bit. The receiver is perfect for home theater, particularly DD 5.1 shows. There is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content, which is important for TV watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments.\\n\\nAs for power, it\\'s not an even match with some of the more power hungry and expensive analog amplifiers out there, but it easily crosses the threshold of annoying the neighbors.\\n\\nDigital is something to get used to. On conventional receivers, you turn the sound up high and it becomes somewhat sloppy, or what some call \"warm\". Not so with the digital Panny. It\\'s distortion free up to very high levels. I wouldn\\'t call it bright, but the response is very linear and precise. I like hearing all the details in music and cinema, even at loud volume. Others don\\'t.\\n\\nThe weaknesses are very minor:\\n\\n-The FM tuner is nothing special.\\n-It lacks fancy DSP modes of expensive receivers.\\n-No fancy on screen display (must do most of the tweaking with knobs)\\n-It does not upconvert video.\\n-The remote control is an el cheapo.\\n\\nFor this price, though, who cares\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this receiver from Fry\\'s Electronics in San Diego, CA for $199.99. At first, I was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver. When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it\\'s home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30\\'s as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections.

Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn\\'t as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it\\'s not nearly as soft as some I\\'ve seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don\\'t need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn\\'t be happier\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nat such low price, this player is really pretty good.\\n\\nit gets the job done, even though the UI is a little bit basic.\\n\\nit can record in DVD+R and DVD-R, and has a 10 hour mode.

The reason behind that is because they\\'re truly excellent headphones. The range is spectacular and the inputs even more so. You\\'re given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical), which is all you really need. \\n\\nMovies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind, in front, and to your left and right when you\\'re connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds \\'boomier\\' and a tad crisper than Dolby D does, especially in Gladiator. \\n\\nHonestly, I\\'ve nothing to complain about. As a college guy, I couldn\\'t bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which, I might add, never sounded as good as my headphones, mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You\\'d be amazed at Coldplay\\'s \"The Scientist\" if you heard it on these headphones. It\\'s indescribable.\\n\\nAnd by the way, I\\'m a slight audiophile.\\n\\nYou seriously can\\'t go wrong with these headphones. And $65 for each additional pair of headphones, allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station? Even better...good idea for families in apartments.\\n\\nIncredibly advanced technology, incredible sound, and incredible results. Can\\'t go wrong here.\\n\\nOh, and they\\'re extremely comfy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI just recently purchased the Quickcam STX for my sister who lives overseas in Greece. It\\'s a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis. Surprisingly, the video and audio is quite good. I do have a Mac and she doesn\\'t have any issue calling me from her pc.  We use Aol instant messenger (Video and Audio) or Yahoo Messenger (Video) to connect.  I still prefer the iSight for Macs.  Unfortunately, you can\\'t use an iSight on a pc. Wish Apple could make the iSight compatible with PC\\'s. Anyhow the STX is a great cam for what it\\'s worth.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis samll web cam is doing a great job connecting my families overseas. The flexible shoe is really handy and the image and voice quality is beyond my expectation\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nhave had no problems with this item, and it\\'s a good price for the powered kind of USB hubs, which I have found are pretty necessary for most USB items. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI found the sound fantastic. Just got these after usinf Shure E3s for about a year. I liked those but find these even better. When I first tried them I found the base so much stronger than the E3s as many have alluded to. Now I run my iPod at normal equalizer settings. I find the balance of the set dead on. The fit is great, of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is my second FM transmitter and works much better than the Belkin that I ended up returning because it simply wasn\\'t working.\\n\\nIt plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there, unlike the Belkin (I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci). It is easy to use with the preset FM stations. It works right out of the box, you\\'ll be ready to go within seconds. The sound is crisp, with some static interference, which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car\\'s antenna helps a little but doesn\\'t completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.\\nThere is nothing to mount the iPod so you\\'ll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t spend more than $45 on any FM transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas. I won\\'t be getting rid of my CD changer just yet\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord.\\n\\nStrengths: Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3!  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it.  \\nThe other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \\nThe battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \\nWiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed\\nJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.\\n\\nWeaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it\\'s way better)\\n\\nProblems: Don\\'t use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\\n\\nConclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis phone has noticably greater range and clarity than our other wireless phones.

I updated it with the new drivers and software on the Creative site (from January 2006) immediately and I have not had any of the problems others mention.  The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1, but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality.\\n\\nVideo calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement, but for basic conversations, it is fine.  I use 8 Mbs cable and I connect with people using the same or high speed DSL.\\n\\nThis camera takes great video &amp; photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you.  If you want to take a large group shot, it is really cool.  The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well.  I don\\'t use the face tracking.  \\n\\nThe base deserves a mention too.  I use this on my notebook and on my desktop.  It\\'s cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces.  Highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate Amazon is offering\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days.\\nThe mouse is very good, a tad small, but still very comfortable. Not as good as  Logitechï¿½ MX(tm)500 for my hand (I\\'d say I have a medium size hand), but still a very solid product. Side buttons are very useful. No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior. Just plug it in and use.\\nThe keyboard is so-so. It is not bad, but just not very comfortable, especially compared to Microsoft keyboards. (I use Microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines). The labeling is very small, Insert/Delete keys are not standard and I hate Vista ready button, if you hit it in the middle of the game you are lucky not to crash.\\nWould I buy it again? Yes.

What I found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic.  In fact, the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended.\\n\\nMy recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted, to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic.  Bose replaced them with no hassles, no receipt, no registration, just sent them back and got a brand new pair.  I think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It\\'s great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative\\'s website).  I\\'m very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it\\'s playing or not.  There\\'s even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3\\'s, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAgain, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    \\ni tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.\\nright now, im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano, then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.\\n one more thing, if your going to use the line-in cable for a device other than the zen micro, be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers line-in jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review. \\nI love these speakers and i even use them for my t.v and they sound great for that too\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought these speakers based on price because I just wanted to get some budget speakers to start off with on my home theater.  It turns out that these speakers have amazing sound quality easily rivaling speakers that cost 10x the price.\\n\\nI really can\\'t find one bad thing to say.  Even at high volumes they have a crystal clear pristine sound.  The sub woofer pumps a nice rich heavy bass. Take advantage of the low price on these speakers, you won\\'t find a better deal.\\n\\nI\\'m using these speakers with a Harman Kardon AVR 240 receiver and I also have two Polk R15\\'s as my front left and right\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nnice little system but only 4 ohms so doesnt handle a lot of power.

We love them, and in shopping around found them to be one of the best home theater values. The sound is great, and the speakers are perfect for just about any home theater need\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nPurchased this iterm for my HP8450 printer. Pictures are outstanding and the cartridge does the job.Only problem is the cartridge gets eaten up in no time at all. Cost per print no bargain. Problem isn\\'t with the catridge, but with the printer and print process. Now we know why HP has printers at such reasonable price. They eat you up and spit you out via the price of cartidges. That\\'s where the real profit lies. Amazon is tops in price and service delivery\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAbout 2 1/2 years ago I finally got into the digital age.  I began printing my own pictures and have tried every brand of photo paper out there (Kodak, HP, store brands, etc. etc.).  By far, the most superior paper is Canon.  They make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints GREAT photos.  \\n\\nI did a wedding album using Canon photo paper and the couple I gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they\\'d hired, which speaks volumes to the quality of Canon paper.\\n\\nI\\'d highly recommend that people use this brand.  You won\\'t be sorry\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nEchoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don\\'t wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven\\'t put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.\\n\\nLearning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\\n\\nIt may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does, and success is not guaranteed.  But it\\'s worth it! And to save your hearing, don\\'t forget to turn down the volume, since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis was the largest set that would fit into my space. I also looked at the Westinghouse 37 inch HD moniter at Best Buy. The first time, I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy. Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp. I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD, the picture is amazing. It\\'s also quite good on regular TV. \\nMy only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in.

I was told Seagate was top of the line.  It truly is.  No problems at all, easy to setup and use, and a fair price.  I highly recommend Seagate over any other brand name (I\\'ve heard problems with other brands)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a great little piece of hardware. \\n\\nI bought it for my MP3\\'s and movies, and I\\'m very pleased. It\\'s totally \"plug-n-play\"; there aren\\'t even any drivers that need updating, assuming you have XP up to par. \\n\\nIt gives 160GB (well, 149 in actuality) of space to work with. After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once, on the first day, it froze up. After that minor incident, I\\'ve had no problems, though, and my machine runs alot faster because of it. With my 100G of music already on it, I\\'m very happy with it. It has given me no fuss--it doesn\\'t even give me any noise! It\\'s as silent as a fart, and that\\'s a big plus.\\n\\nI found mine at Wal-Mart for $114 and I think that I made a good purchase. If you\\'re on a budget, this is about as good as it gets. Seagate\\'s 300GB is also highly recommended, as I\\'ve worked with it before. A+\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis drive is whisper quiet, easy to install and use, and in my experience, plenty fast. I recently encoded my CD collection in flac format and am using this drive to store files. I also used foobar2000/LAME to convert the flac files to MP3, all on this drive. During the process of converting the files, which is pretty IO-intensive, I found the drive to be completely reliable and the speed to be more than adequate\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this radio to keep on my kitchen counter.  I chose Boston Acoustics over Tivoli because you can\\'t preset the stations in the Tivoli and I like to flip through commercials. Other reviewers wrote that the bass can be overpowering.  I listen to rock music and do not notice the bass. My complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly.  It does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house.  Also if you are listening to the radio you can\\'t see the time display.\\n\\nThis radio is great if you have limited space.  It looks good and sounds like a much larger radio. It has a lot of power for a small radio.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nExcellent accessory, portable and you do not have to apply anything permanent to your vehicle....highly recommended\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWow!

So I was interested in maximizing performance. When I called their office for advice, one of the tech guys (excellent service, by the way) told me the Monster banana plugs were great, not the best or most expensive available, but a good value. That was enough for me. My speakers are bi-wired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful.

I just had to set it up - I haven\\'t had any cause to touch it since, it\\'s very reliable. Highly recommended\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nUnit works about as expected, with possible exception of a few areas of the screen that are not too sensitive to the touches from the stylus.  So far I am working around that.  This is my 3rd Deluxe and the 1st one to give any operational problem of any sort.  Generally a good product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nYeah, so apparently this was a really good PDA to buy. I BOUGHT THIS THREE YEARS AGO AND IT STILL WORKS! Ive been searching for a new PDA since I thought this one was so out of date, and when reading all the reviews I came across many new \"state of the art\" PDAs that broke after only a few months. This baby has been great to me for three long years, so if you are looking for a reliable buy, go for this. Definately NOT flashy, very basic. All I use it for is appointments, dates, and to-dos. GREAT FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO USE A PDA AS AN AGENDA! \\n\\nGood luck on your PDA search!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am working with my new PDA the Live Drive and is great to have akk ny videos, music and to write my notes and documents before my shift or meeting, and also the wireless connection is so great. I like the option that you can use it as an external drive\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am extremely happy with this purchase and will most likely purchase another one of these, soon\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNetgear clearly has not figured out how to make their RangeMax adapter work well with the Microsoft XP operating system.  If you\\'re not a techie, I\\'d stay away until Microsoft has certified the WPN311. Here\\'s what I experienced:\\n\\n1. Installed using the Netgear WPN311 automated configuration.\\n2. After installation completion and boot up, CPU utilization was at a solid 100%.  Executable from Netgear named WLANCFG5.EXE taking up a bunch of the CPU and Microsoft routines CSRSS.EXE, NET.EXE, and NET1.EXE taking the rest.\\n3. Emailed Netgear and received response to use Task Manager to delete WLANCFG5.EXE.  Did so for all users.\\n4. Hey!  CPU utilization returned to normal!\\n5. Sent next email to Netgear pointing out that this solution is just a \"patch\" and WLANCFG5 would return when I re-booted.\\n6. Received response to de-install and re-install software for WPN311.\\n7. Did so, but then Netgear adapter software could not find my MIMO wireless router!  And usage of the Netgear adapter software doesn\\'t allow you to use the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configurator (WZC).\\n8. Went to microsoft.com and looked up error 871122 \"Error message when you try to run the Wireless Network Setup Wizard\" and followed the instruction to allow usage of WZC.\\n9. Then able to add my wireless router and everything is ok.\\n\\nThe functionality works great.  It\\'s the getting there that\\'s not too pretty good.....\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI lost my previous RadioShack surge strip and the various pieces of equipment attached to it in the Queens power failure and wanted something dependable. The price is great for its rating and all the stuff included, and it is kind of cool-looking too!  Recommend without reservation\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m using the Monster Cable MP Home Theater PowerCenter HTS800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a high-end tube pre-amp.  The line noise is removed beautifully; however, the PowerCenter itself creates a high-pitched tone.  The tone comes out of the PowerCenter device directly.  If you are planning to use this product on a high-end sound system, I recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor the background, I\\'ve owned &amp; used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75.  Here\\'s my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Very good bass &amp; well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\\n2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I\\'d need to crank up the vol.)\\n3. Very light weight\\n4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\\n5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &amp;iM716 have better isolation)\\n6. Moderately priced ($50)\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\\n2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\\n3. No pouch or case\\n\\nPS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80\\'s experience :\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAll in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it\\'s physics, there\\'s nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \\n\\nThese headphones are called \"asymmetric,\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn\\'t spill on the wire.\\n\\nI paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the 4th spindle I\\'ve ordered and I haven\\'t had a problem with any of my DVDs. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis little charger works great. It is the second one of it\\'s kind that I have purchased. The last one took a lot of abuse and therefore I needed to replace it. Would buy it again. Charges quickly and is quite handy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Fang is amazing!!!!! I just got it,theres nothing like it. The keyz are in the perfect spot to kill all your fellow gamers. all you need is the fang and a mouse and your good to go. you have to get this if you want to stand a chance in FPS games.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI love the new nanos. I don\\'t think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I\\'d rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren\\'t as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don\\'t know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don\\'t notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I\\'m so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am satisfied. Works great with my Phone Nokia E6\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have to say, when I first purchased this little goodie, I just assumed I was buying more memory for my Motorola Q.

I bought a Passport, and the USB outlet on my Macbook powers it perfectly well.  I don\\'t need an external power supply.\\n\\nBtw, I get a transfer rate of about 2 Mb/s, or 1 Gb/5 minutes.  This seems a little slow, but it doesn\\'t bother me much.  The Passport is small, has a nice rubber coating to prevent shock, and overall is worth the purchase price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese Verbatim discs have the DataLife Plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100+ years. I\\'m a professional photographer and it\\'s crucial to store my client\\'s digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come. I\\'ve tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data (read errors) many times but so far with the hundreds of Verbatim discs I\\'ve burned so far, I haven\\'t had a problem yet. The Kodak brand discs were also excellent, but Kodak discontinued making them. SONY also makes a good disc. These discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the Epson R200/R300/R320, and the surface area is printable right up to the hub! I have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as Verbatim continues to make a great disc\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese Verbatims are terrific.  As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually, you\\'re safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim\\'s are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I\\'ve bought one every couple months and I\\'m on my 3rd spindle now.\\n\\nThey have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned, dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200).  Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos.  Not one coaster so far, burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X, it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMR-E55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly).  So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) .  Over 134 discs so far, and they look great, play great, and are a great price for hub printable discs.   Highly recommended...I\\'m ordering more!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNotebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.  Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues.  B\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had the previous version also. It is so far the best webcam I ever owned. Don\\'t even bother to compare it with cheap creative ones. The frame rate and picture quality is awesome. Works in very low light conditions and has great software which can even make gieco or alien out of you. \\n\\nThey keep on working for years. My old one \"Quickcam for notebooks Pro\" still a champion after use of 3 years now. I got bored and gave it to my uncle. And boy he loves it too. Newer one as mentioned by other reviewers holds much better.\\n\\nDo I sound Like a logitech sales person? Well I must admit that I am very happy with their webcams. Amazon offers get price and you should get it.\\n\\nOne more thing. It\\'s features outweighs its small size :). My Parents back in other part of world can see even tiny things in my room which they shouldn\\'t :).\\n\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this mouse because I have developed carpel tunnel pain in my shoulder from years and years of mouse activity. I\\'m happy to say it is nearly gone (the pain) - I ordered one for my office and will now get one for home.  It does take a bit of getting used to (after years of movable mouse action) - but it can be done.\\n\\nGood luck\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nUnlike many other cables that splice A/V output, this cable does so while retaining the details of that output.  I.e., both Left and Right channels are extracted and outputted, not simply the Left channel with audio mixed down to mono.  Also, it works on some computers, too!\\n\\nOn the minus side, I haven\\'t gotten it to work on the television.  In order to do so, you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player.\\n\\nI bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an X-Rocker chair with built in speakers, and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible, too.  For that, it was worth the cost\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats, etc. Very handy! The unit did all that it promised, but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation, but not recording or EQ.\\n\\nNeeded additions:\\n1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??!? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky. Better to have \"radio buttons\" associated with the App window. To be fair, the Widget does have better station selection, but the button is labeled with a \\'heart\\'...\\n2. No station \"scan\" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.\\n3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multi-band EQ that works well, mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also, one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though, for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this:  AUDACITY.\\n\\nOddities\\n1. When first installed, the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings, they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions. Re-installed software and it began working well.\\n2. Initially did not seem to work well thru an external (powered) hub; now has no problems. Though, unit does work okay with a USB extension cable\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a total bargain. Not only was the price right, it works perfectly in the car, at home converting every radio to a stereo system for my iPod Nano. When they\\'re put together it looks like one unit and if, by chance, you use a Motorola Rzr phone the charger works with he iTrip and recharges the Nano, eliminating the need for any other charger devices\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe over-the-air picture is crisp, colors are bright and the size is just right. Pretty good viewing angle as well\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI totally recommend this mouse. I purchased the 1st mouse a few months about and just now bought another one for my other laptop.  I like it that you have an assortment of colors you can chose from also. The battery life is pretty good also\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI use this with an iMac. It does not come with drivers for Mac OS X, nor does D-Link offer any help. They refuse to admit it will work with Macs. I was pointed toward a driver made available at [...]. I remember having trouble getting it to work, but once it was working it has worked well and consistently. The iMac connects to an AEBS a couple rooms away through the D-Link\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have been going nuts trying to find a decent set of headphones for my new iPod.  All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course!  And man- they still have it.  These aren\\'t the greatest phones I\\'ve ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice, full- the bass doesn\\'t thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it\\'s smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I\\'ve ever owned!  My bottom line- anyone who doesn\\'t grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve tried several different brands of headsets and this one wins. It reduces noise, has excellent sound and is comfortable for hours at a time. My office is between the shop, where we make rocket engines, and the flight line on the airport, where airplanes are tested. Sometimes jet aircraft sit outside my window and perform engine run-ups, or idle the APU for hours. This headset reduces the white noise while still allowing me to hear the phone ring even when a local F-4 Phantom II tests the afterburner.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nGood price. Good company. I use this on my Kodak CX7300 and it\\'s fine. Good product to buy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWorks as advertised, have not had a single problem with it since installing it in my Tungsten T\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBought this a few months ago for my 3yr old son.  He loves it.  We have used it in the car as well as when he goes to meetings with me.  Never had a single problem with it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe bought this product for a long car trip and the kids loved it. I\\'ve also used it and thought the sound and picture were wonderful. It was exactly what we were looking for and for a fantastic price! We are very happy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I\\'ve used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)\\n\\nI believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.\\n\\nWhat do you REALLY get for a \"high end\" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don\\'t know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!\\n\\nWhat does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:\\n---\\n\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"\\n\\n---\\nA digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn\\'t degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\\n\\nOverall, I\\'m very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)\\n\\n(P.S. for first time users, don\\'t forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you\\'ll never need them again.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had this phone now about 3 months and I am VERY HAPPY with it. IT has all the things and want and many more, The hand sets are very clear and I love the fact I can check voice mail on any hand set that goes with it I do not have to run to the main answering machine to check the voice mail. The range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this.  So far I love everything with this phone, It is much better than either of the last two phone I have had. I have walked over a 1/2 block from the house and it still works clearly, I have never had a phone that worked so far away from home\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased the Notebook Cooler approximately one month ago, after reading online testimonials of laptops becoming damaged from overheating. Thankfully, the same time I read that, Circuit City was having a sale on this item for only $15, after mail-in rebate. Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \\n\\nMy laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I\\'ll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don\\'t really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it\\'s really hot in the room, or if I\\'m running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \\n\\nOverall, I\\'d say I\\'m very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Logitech MX 400 mouse in my opinion was a good buy.  It is very reliable, accurate, scrolls smooth, and is precise and responsive on every surface I have used it on.  It is also light weight and comfortable, making it the purfect mouse for the price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They\\'ve both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn\\'t affected by it so I don\\'t consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it \"should,\" but likewise, it\\'s something to be expected with this much use and hasn\\'t affected comfort.\\n\\nThe cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I\\'m used to, which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.\\n\\nI\\'ve compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ-50\\'s (which I own) and a library\\'s Koss UR-10\\'s or 15\\'s (can\\'t remember which).  Though the QZ-50\\'s do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20\\'s are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won\\'t eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50\\'s\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently bought these speakers because I wanted to play my iPod in the office. The sound is better then expected.  While I would get a better speaker system for my home, for the office or on the go, these will do very nicely\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMyself and my grandchildren love to hold these adorable pets, their fun. lifelike and surprisingly sturdy. Get one!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhat a relief to find this mouse after having bought a Microsoft 6000 lazer mouse which caused my tendonitis to flare up again really bad.  I had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another Microsoft \"ergonomic\" mouse a year ago, which became chronic, but barely noticeable until I tried the 6000.\\n\\nI also tried a Logitech V200, which is a good mouse, just not nearly as comfortable as the 450.  The buttons on both of these Logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless.  This was not so on the MS 6000.\\n\\nIf you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook, the Logitech V450 is it.  My hands are fairly large, and for the $15 more than the v200, it is definitely worth it as I spend a lot of time on computers\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis laser version tracks much better on odd surfaces compared to the Logitech V200 I have.\\n\\nThe Setpoint software allows you to use Setpoint\\'s mouse sensativity independent of the touchpad settings.  Finally!!!  I dont have to change mouse sensativities when I unplug it.  The Setpoint sensativity is an offset to window\\'s sensativity setting for the touchpad.  So basically, set your touchpad sensativity first, then adjust the Setpoint sensativity.  They will be work just the way you want everytime you unplug/plug the mouse and going back and forth between touchpad and mouse.\\n\\nPerfect product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nJBL speaker system for IPOD is an outstanding product, I would highly recommend it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a product too unique for me not too try.  I\\'ve struggling with lost receipts and always in a panic mode when tax day comes.  There\\'s just no other easy way I\\'ve found to keep track of all my receipts.  \\n\\nEven with some of the negativity about the accuracy on the receipt recognition, I still wanted to try this out for myself.\\n\\nI noticed the following will increase the accuracy of the receipt scanning:\\n\\n1) Scan your receipt ASAP once you have it.  Receipts are pretty cheap in quality and will fade over time.  Also for that matter, you risk the chance of loosing the receipt the longer you don\\'t scan it in.  =)\\n\\n2) Ink quality on the receipt matters.\\nIt does the best job when the dots of the letters/number are together and dark.\\n\\n3)wording on the receipt.\\ne.g. the receipt can say visa/mc then scanner will pick it as visa.\\n\\nBusiness card scans have been excellent for me.  Be sure to upgrade your sw to the lastest version.  Mine is 2.55 at the time of writing\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have used this and the optical cable.  For $20 less, it sounds just as good.

Why pay so much more for other indoor antennas such as Terk or Samsung. I tried both of those but ended up with the Zenith at a fraction of the price and with much better reception\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI live in Manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception. I use it hooked up to an HP 3200 lcd tv with built-in tuner. It took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception. The cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light. I have it resting atop my center channel speaker. $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is very comfortable and works very well.  It\\'s heavy enough that it doesn\\'t move around or push the keyboard, as some of the other types of wrist rests that I\\'ve used have done.  Yet it\\'s cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI type medical reports for a living, up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week. Without the wrist rest, my wrists would not be able to hold up. The wrist rest is the perfect size. It stays in place on the desk. The gel continues to be supportive, even after a year of working on it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell. I can\\'t smell it while typing, only when I pick it up for cleaning. I wish there was the option for half stars - I\\'d give this 4-1/2 stars\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWorks well....Customer support from Garmin....more than excellent...One complaint..Very short battery life...Requires a 12 volt charging adapter...Windshield suction cup charge adapter is a must to use as a G.P.S....Also...Get a minimum 512 MB SD card for combo marine and street navigation....One plus is the brightness,unit size,and screen size....Do not keep it in your breast pocket while on the boat...Dont float..not waterproof..nuff said\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis product took less than 5 minutes to unbox, install, and work properly. Well built, and functions exactly as I would have hoped. I am impressed with the ability of the suction cup to stay attached, even in the summer heat of Las Vegas\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a very simple product that works as advertised. Easy to set up within MacOS X. I use the AirTunes functionality which is very cool. I don\\'t use the USB printing. While more expensive than other 802.11g routers/access points, the simplicity + AirTunes functionality make it worth the extra money\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis Uniden phone/answering system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago.  Here\\'s a list of the other things about this phone that I like most:\\n1.  The corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off.  This, along with price, was the main reason I bought this phone system.  This feature is unusual for a cordless phone system.\\n2.  The controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you don\\'t have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording.\\n3.  Also, the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.\\n4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week, sometimes more.\\n5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.\\n\\nHowever, there is something about this phone system that I don\\'t like.\\n--The cordless handset has a pretty limited range.  I had to locate the base unit in a central location in my 2,300 square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms.\\n\\nBut overall I think the phone is a good buy, if you can live with the distance restrictions of the cordless handset\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVery effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone I have. Sound is ok for what it does. However, in a moving vehicle, it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noise-cancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise-cancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music, the intruding noise is over. Otherwise, no complains\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was debating over the PictureMate, Kodak Printer Dock 3, Sony DDP-FP50, and the HP Photosmart 475. I made the choice of the HP and I LOVE IT! The prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints. I use the HP 4x6 boarderless Premium Plus photo paper with the HP Ink and the prints are just wonderful. Forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all. (...) The HP produces bright, vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime. The PictureMate is also alot larger than the HP 475. The 1.5GB hard drive is a plus as well. HP said that the remote is not included but they lied, they come with the remote and battery. Overall, this printer is the best I have own\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese DVDs are absolutely top quality, and you really need to use bad DVDs to know how bad they can get.  I ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far.  Not a single coaster, and Nero data verification (I always do that for DVDs) has not brought up any errors ever.  BTW, the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files.  The burner is the DVD multi drive on my Dell Inspiron Laptop (1505).\\n\\nHowever, I should mention (to those who haven\\'t bought this product) why they are called Shiny Silver.  You know that print on the top of DVDs with lines and that matte finish?  Well, there\\'s no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I\\'m talking about- No special surface; however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.  Huge cost cutting here I guess, but definitely not in the quality department.  I will buy again\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI burn a ton of DVDs and have used almost every brand out there.  Many have errors, even the top brand names like Memorex...etc.\\n\\nI have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting.  \\n\\nI\\'ve switched all DVD media purchases to Verbatim.  They are by far, the best of them all.  Would recommend to everyone\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFirst off, these puppies sound good! However, there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know:\\n\\nThe sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn\\'t permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \\ni didn\\'t give it five stars.\\n\\nAlso, the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) &amp; RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn\\'t realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.\\n\\nRiding while using them can be dangerous, since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. \\n\\nBang for the buck, ( I paid $69.99 on amazon), I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchase two of these phones to add to our base unit. Very easy set up. Quality product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had slight confusion whether to choose the sony 64 MB memory stick, which is nearly the same price or this one, which has twice the memory capacity of the previous one. I choose this one for the better deal and to add to my surprise J&amp;R Electronics shipped it so quickly(You guys Rock!!!). This one comes par with sony memory media in every field. So why choose the one with lesser memory capacity. Choose this one and feed your camera with some memory space\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nDelivered on time, no problems setting it up (just followed the instructions to format it because I didn\\'t want the default format it comes with, which is less safe). It\\'s been running fine ever since I bought it. I can\\'t comment on the speed of access because, since I leave it backing up over night, I don\\'t really care. It\\'s all done in the morning anyway, so I don\\'t really need anything faster\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI like this unit. It is hooked up to an S-Video in from my Digital Cable Box, and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV. Picture quality is very good; I\\'m very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P, but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box, but then I\\'ve not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program, deleted it, and then recorded again, it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy, anyhow. \\nAll told, I\\'d recommend this DVD recorder without hesitation\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI don\\'t normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can\\'t go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn\\'t wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer\\'s codes which they list in a handy guide.  If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won\\'t be disappointed\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk...I WAS TOTALLY WRONG!!! These are great, they give the bass right where you want it. Sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much. Watch out these come on sale instores for around $8.00 sometimes. That\\'s where i got my 1st pair\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe sound range and clarity is quite good, they are comfortable. My only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes, I\\'d like to use it with my computer not a MP3 attached to my belt\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple\\'s part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It\\'s smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.\\n\\nIt holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it\\'s still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother\\'s mp3 player, needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it\\'s job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.\\n\\nAnother huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod \"family\" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I\\'ve actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that\\'s how much I love it!\\n\\nFor having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it\\'s amazing!    \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI haven\\'t written any reviews for Amazon before, but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball, I had to respond.  I\\'ve been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90\\'s when Kensington first came out with the \"Turbo Mouse\".  It was great then, and now it\\'s better.  This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don\\'t understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it\\'s worth that.  It\\'s a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.  If you need (or want) a high performance trackball that you\\'ll be able to use with many computers to come, get this one\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese speakers are awesome for the price.  They charge your ipod even when the unit is off.  The sound quality is great for around 50 bucks.  I bought these for traveling and they are small enough to fit in a suitcase without taking up too much room.  They also stack so they don\\'t take up much counter space.  I can\\'t say enough about the sound quality.  They are great\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI work for a small sized consulting engineer\\'s firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text (magazine articles, old projects, letters from the client, books, etc).\\n\\nWe got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner ( still working ) and we have been impressed with its speed, small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality PDF files.\\n\\nA couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them.\\n\\nPROS :\\n- incredibly easy to use ( you don\\'t need to teach anybody )\\n- fast for PDF scanning\\n- great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled )\\n- very small, perfect for a desk\\n- good construction quality, no one of our 4 scanners ever broke\\n\\nCONS :\\n- quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams, double-feeding that some time occurs.\\n- not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ).\\n\\nI strongly suggest it for small-medium sized businesses to scan documents.\\n\\nIf you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better. \\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe CD sound is like being at the concert. Hooking the radio up to a television makes the home theater experience even better. The  fm radio receiption is even clear. Great quality product. Worth the money\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese are some great headphones with a few minor flaws:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Great sound quality\\n2. Very comfortable\\n3. Light\\n4. Worry-free charging\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy, could require pressing the tune-in button several times\\n2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast\\n3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)\\n\\nMy experience: I\\'ve had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it\\'s not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \\n\\nRegardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd\\'s.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \\n\\nFirst off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn\\'t 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \\n \\nWhat brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \\n\\nOnce I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \\n\\nSince I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \\n\\nMy test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren\\'t drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \\n\\nAll in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\\n\\nGood:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\\n\\nBad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\\n\\nFor their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\nJust a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy \\'toys\\' before exploring what it is that they\\'re buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\\n\\na- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software\\'s auto-boot.\\n\\nb- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I\\'m guessing that those company\\'s that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the \\'Uninstaller\\' on their site.\\n\\nc- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim &amp; Memorex.\\n\\nd- For those who want portable software but don\\'t want U3 or don\\'t have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\\n\\ne- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics \\'toys\\' available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don\\'t meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\\n\\ng- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent \\'roll-back\\' feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G\\'s pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn\\'t be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3\\'s, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won\\'t cut it because XP ain\\'t as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software \\'toys\\' that run under 2K, and the \\'admin\\' can prevent you from loading a lot of software \\'toys\\'.\\n\\nh- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you\\'ll have better luck getting what you want, and you won\\'t look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\\n\\ni- When you truly understand the product, you\\'ll be able to write TRULY useful reviews, and that what all readers want, useful information.\\n\\nTo one and all, may your \\'toys\\' keep you happy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVery easy to use.

Installed and self-configured in minutes.  Very small, light, no additional power cords to worry about, no additional software (beyond the automatically installed drivers) to install - quick and easy.  Only issue I found is that the antenna is permanent, so you could never swap for replacement/better antenna like you can on some other wireless NICs\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis cover is very durable, however it is somewhat difficult to get the ipod into the case.  The case covers the entire ipod except for small vent holes so it is very water resistant, but the case covers the locking button making it harder to lock and unlock the ipod\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house. To start, I bought only one additional phone. I\\'ll buy the rest later. So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that I have found very useful. Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.\\n\\nYou can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the \"Living Rm\" rather than phone #3, etc.\\n\\nIf you have caller ID, you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn\\'t transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. \\n\\nAlso, on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own, the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say \"home\", etc. On this phone, the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. \\n\\nI think the phone is great, I just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature.\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nKingston\\'s 2GB Data Traveler USB drive is perfect to storage files.

I had problems installing the unit and was on the telephone with HP Tech support (India) for 1.75 hours, I spent very little time on hold.\\n\\nThe largest draw back to the unit is my computer acts like the DC4000 is not there from time to time and required me to reboot the computer in order to use this nifty device\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \\n\\nThe E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \\n\\nI am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \\n\\nI also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\\n\\nMy biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi\\'s 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \\n\\nI bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is.

A cable of stunning, high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you\\'ll think you\\'re watching scenes through a glass window and not through a television/monitor, a bold claim indeed, BUT, quite true never-the-less. I was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better. This cable brings to the viewer ALL the picture, and, yes, that does mean \"Warts and all\"so, be prepared to see the smallest of detail, like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work \"Un-seen\". Who really needs HDTV when cables like Monster\\'s MVS3-1M are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing television/monitor for only a minute fraction of the cost.

They sound great to my ear and I use them alot\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can\\'t beat that price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is an affordable option that provides a lot of memory and allows USB 2.0 protocol for very fast transfer. If you need to transfer data from one digital product to another, this is very handy and I think that every person dealing a lot with data should have one.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI basically bought these because they were cheap. Cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example. The UR-20 provides excellent sound for both music and movies. It has excellent bass and sound isolation.

With 3 handsets, we are spoiled. Also our house has a few phone jacks but they are all located where we did not want a phone and no jacks in our den or living room.

My home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages, mobile phone down for whatever reason, etc.  This is one of the few corded phones with caller ID and no answering machine built in.  The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless, etc.  Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen.

I have done the heat treatment (using boiling water) and the headphones seemed to open up more. When the headphones came in the box, the ear pieces were really close together. So I can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head.\\n\\nI plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more.\\n\\nSOUND.\\n\\nSound quality is excellent.\\n\\nCOMFORT.\\n\\nThe only thing I don\\'t really like is this style of headphone. I don\\'t really like the band to go around the back of my head, causing my ears to support the headphones. I like the ones that go over the top of your head.\\n\\nCOMPATIBILITY.\\n\\nI have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter. These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes (PSP also) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord.\\n\\nFEATURES.\\n\\nCoolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls!

I have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they\\'ll last, but I use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they haven\\'t failed me yet.\\n\\nThe only reason I would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use.  I\\'m not really a big fan of this \"sport\" style of headphone, and probably wouldn\\'t have tried these if I hadn\\'t gotten them on clearance.  But, I found that after experimenting a little I was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable, even wearing them the better part of a workday\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe keyboard is good quality and the best product I could find for the price. I recommend if you are looking for a low profile keyboard w/numeric entry pad that takes a mimimum anount of desk space.  The keypad has the feel of a large notebook computer.  So makes a great docking station keyboard if you are used to the slim kepads on most modern laptop computers.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFirst off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\\n\\nInstallation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\\n\\nOne big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn\\'t true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic\\'s claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn\\'t sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it\\'s going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\\n\\nNow for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven\\'t purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I\\'m comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn\\'t worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It\\'s not bad, but it\\'s going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\\n\\nAs with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer\\'s website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'m very impressed so far, and I\\'m really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can\\'t complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m using this AP, along with a Netgear 802.11g PC Card to test streaming live/recorded TV to other parts of my house.  Seems like a capable product even if I didn\\'t use the 108Mbps feature.\\n\\nHowever, be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it, configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network\\'s DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.\\n\\nI noticed that there is are hordes of wireless APs around my house, I guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well.  However, this D-Link AP is able to function correctly abeit all the other APs around (2 using the same channel as mine I\\'ve found).\\n\\n\\nOverall, recommended if you want a good AP.  Just be sure to update the firmware\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe sound quality is pretty darn good, except that if you pace around while talking/listening, there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite, and, if you stand still they go away.  I\\'ve had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around, and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking - at least this phone doesn\\'t do that.  \\n\\nMy 900 MHz DSS Uniden didn\\'t have these sounds (while pacing or otherwise), and still had greater range.  I don\\'t know why the new technology can\\'t measure up.  Still though, this is the best 5.8 I\\'ve tried.  (Yet I\\'d rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore.  All of today\\'s 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)\\n\\nAnother annoying thing is that you can\\'t recharge the phone with the belt clip attached, so the clip goes on and off (and on and off).  (Many (cell) phones have a charger that allows this.)\\n\\nThe plastic is a bit cheap.  Don\\'t drop this phone.  My friend has one and it hasn\\'t worked since it was dropped.\\n\\n(I haven\\'t tried the bluetooth yet, and have yet to see how good the battery life is.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this base and added 6 TCX805 handsets to it.  The whole setup works great.  I got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone.  That features works well, there\\'s a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that\\'s trivial.  I will say this, you need to keep your cell phone within about 20\\' of this base.  I just take mine off, turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.\\n\\nSo if you want the cell dialing feature and like the more traditional upright handset, get this base and expand it with other handsets. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis product is great - allowed me to connect a distant printer to my computer by hooking two of the extension cables together.  Worked right away - no problems\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a great headset for my use.  It is very clear.  I use it for work, and I only make use it periodically throughout the day, making about 10 calls daily so I don\\'t wear it all the time\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nResearched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32\" LCD.   Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   \\nI mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn\\'t be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  \\nI\\'ve also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42\" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There\\'s also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  \\nThe only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can\\'t use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna.  \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had a Zen Vision:M but I returned it because I decided I didn\\'t need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player, so I decided to go with the Zen V since it\\'s interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M\\'s(which I liked).\\n\\nThe first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn\\'t that impressed, but it\\'s really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.\\n\\nThe music is organized your standard Artist-Album-Song interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still, it\\'s as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hit-or-miss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.\\n\\n The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard, although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  \\n\\nThe player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also, if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer, album art will not be attached to the music tracks.\\n\\nIf you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bit-rate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player, half as much as advertised.  \\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nPros:\\nExcellent physical design\\nEasy to use interface\\nGood navigation\\nGreat sound quality\\n\\nCons:\\nOn-the-go playlist creation is flawed\\nAlbum art support hit-or-miss\\nSlow transfer speeds from WMP11\\nAccesories rarely available in brick-and-mortar stores\\n\\nUltimately, I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it\\'s vastly superior physical design. \\n\\n\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had these speakers for over a month and I love them they sound awesome. They were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI read the other reviews for these speakers so I had very high expectations. I can only say WOW! The premium price (compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems) is absolutely justified\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor reference, I\\'ve owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\\n\\nI initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1\\'s because of the fantastic reviews they\\'ve gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend\\'s ProMedia 4.1\\'s (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\\n\\nI tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500\\'s which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\\n\\nSo... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021\\'s which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they\\'re probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\\n\\nThe sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\\n\\nSubwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It\\'s very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn\\'t shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn\\'t have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don\\'t sound right to me.\\n\\nPROs:\\n* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\\n* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\\n* Power button on control pod\\n* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they\\'re on, not while they off. 100% silent.\\n\\nCONs:\\n* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren\\'t always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\\n* Remote is a bit useless\\n* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\\n* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\\n\\nAnd finally, don\\'t be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn\\'t matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn\\'t pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve owned these Altec\\'s for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I\\'m very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I\\'m confident that this is the most crisp sound you\\'ll find in any speaker\\n\\nVOLUME --- these suckers can get LOUD - just take my word for it\\n\\nCOMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\\n\\nCONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer\\'s controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\\n\\nSIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy\\n\\nPRICE --- believe me - it\\'s a bargain at under $200!!!\\n\\nOverall, I give my full recommendation here -- you\\'ll love these speakers\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMy sound improvement wasn\\'t as dramatic as many people describe, likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers, but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3\\'s, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I\\'m not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $60.  I kept thinking, what could be so special about it.  Well, I don\\'t know where to begin.  I like it so much, I\\'m getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I\\'d never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn\\'t care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That\\'s not why I got it, although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming, I really didn\\'t notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.\\n\\nMy only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks \"homemade\".\\n\\nI would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a PC\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got the Razor Diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it\\'s performance.  For gaming it\\'s great, but I do not recommended it for everyday mousing around. \\n\\nThe resolution on the Diamondback was the selling point for me, and if that\\'s something your interested in you will NOT be disappointed.  It\\'s really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it\\'s design, but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked!  Oh, it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.\\n\\nDesign problems that I have noticed... Buttons squeak, button placement is not optimal, it\\'s kinda small for people with big hands, programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement. If you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse, highly recommended\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the \"g\" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.  Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So, I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet, over the last 5 hours.\\n\\nThe reason I took away one star is the fact on the Wireless Network Monitor V2.1 there seems to be a flaw.  When I connect to the network and internet the monitor says it is hooked to the network but unable to find the internet.

I am quite pleased with my purchase. Though not stellar audiophile quality, the sound is pretty darn good, and with some minor EQ it\\'s excellent. The noise cancelling effect seems to work very well: much better than I expected. Furthermore, the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed. I highly recommend them\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThere isn\\'t too much to write about this except is delivers as stated.  Great product for the price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI set up a small security program with my Macintosh. Intially I needed a PC to place the settings in the camera, however once I got it hooked up to my security system it works beautifully. I would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you don\\'t you will be getting just a black, fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security. This camera is a very simple easy to use camera without the fuss of zooming, pan, tilt etc. If you need a simple camera you can\\'t go wrong with the D-link DCS-900 (Wireless or wired version)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhat can you say?  I placed my order with Amazon.com.  A few days later the product arrived at my door.  Perfect\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe quality of materials: zipper, hard case, strap and light\\nweight are outstanding. When I connected my MP3 player, the\\nsound was impressive for a-carry along- portable stereo speaker.\\nNext, I took the MP3 out of the speaker case and loaded my DT\\n200V pocket radio; again the sound was very good and even loud\\nat a low volume setting. \\nNow the minor negatives: changing the volume, etc. \\nrequires going into the zipped case. \\nOther than the ipod, be careful in\\nselecting this speaker. The player, radio... cannot be \\nmore than 4\" high, 2.5\" wide and .75\" thick; \\nlarger and you may not be able to zip closed \\nthe speaker case, which is necessary.\\nMy items just do fit. So the Quality Sound \\nand Materials make this a fine product, \\nespecially for the money.\\nOTHER PRODUCTS REVIEWS HAVE GREATLY HELPED ME \\nDECIDE WHAT TO BUY, THIS IS WHY I DID THIS REVIEW. \\nPLEASE DO THE SAME FOR OTHERS AS YOU BUY PRODUCTS.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this package purely for the keyboard. I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together, however.\\n\\nThe keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I\\'ve ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven\\'t gotten used to but it\\'s fine.\\n\\nI have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I\\'ve experienced no problems here, it\\'s spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven\\'t use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.\\n\\nI do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had built-in bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don\\'t use the mouse very much, but the times I do use it I experience no problems.\\n\\nBoth the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.\\n\\nThe battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.\\n\\nOthers complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens, but I haven\\'t had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is, and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.\\n\\nI highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse, or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way, you cannot go wrong with this package, it is extremely excellent\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\n i recently purchased these speakers for my patio setup.  the sound quality wont blow your mind, but it does not sound bad.  its large and lound enough to hear for an outdoor speaker for the price. it has a switch in the back for outdoor/indoor.  not really sure what that does.  very easy installation with the brackets included.  (no screws provided) overall great unit for thye pric\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI agree that these cables are way too expensive!! However that being said, they really do perform well.  I have been using them for almost a year and they are just solid.  Colors always look their best.  I know it was a silly purchase but my DVD\\'s look great.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nOverall, a good phone. Low cost. Well built. Many features.  Speaker works OK for the price.  Features such as caller ID and the speaker phone are powered by batteries.  As stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months, even if you do not use the battery-powered speaker phone often.  This phone would be a great phone (for the price) if it did not use batteries, but was a plug-in model\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor a long time I was looking for a phone to use with skype.  For the price and convenience, Actiontec Internet phone wizard was the best I found and ordered it from Amazon ($42.99 with free shipping).

Awesome\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this to use with my newly acquired Slingbox Pro.  All I had to do was plug these into wall outlets and connect the Lan wires.  Worked like a charm...couldn\\'t believe it was that easy.  Great performance and good price from Amazon\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBottom line up front:\\n\\nWorks very well, very low price, works much better with the \\nincluded drivers than with the generic windows xp driver\\n\\nDetailed review:\\n\\nI bought this so I could use my new Treo 700w with my non-bluetooth-enabled laptop.  The price was my main motivation in buying it.\\n\\nInitially I just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay, however it didn\\'t always work and i\\'d have to unplug/replug for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other.\\n\\nAfter getting tired of that, I decided to install the drivers that ship with the product.  I\\'ve had a much better experience since i did that.  I was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price, but it\\'s actually quite good and gives you a TON of options that the standard XP driver does not provide.\\n\\nIf you use a this with a laptop and you dock/undock it, you\\'ll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to docking/undocking.  Otherwise, you\\'ll probably end up having to unplug/replug it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a corded mouse; fits comfortably in your hand.  Moves smoothly across table surface; works well on a mousepad as well if you need wrist support.\\n\\nWorked out of the box (except for the application button) for the different buttons on the mouse.  The Internet buttons allow for a page forward/ back with your thumb.  There are also line up/down buttonw above and below the scroll wheel that allow for more control in scrolling.\\n\\nThe scroll wheel feel good, better than some other mice I have used.\\n\\nI opted to use the native Windows XP mouse driver, so the application button does not work, but the Windows taskbar is not much of a hardship :-); and I prefer not to clutter up my system with another set of marginal utility software\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt has very good definition but is slow, even in the night is not that good and is slower\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhile the product description states this battery is \"Compatible with Motorola T5320, T5400, T5420, T5600, T5620, T5700, T5720, T5800, and T5820 2-way radios\" the 53615 is compatible with many more.  To bad Amazon couldn\\'t put this online for us.\\n\\nFrom the packaging:\\nT4800 Series\\nT4900 Series\\nT5000\\nT5320\\nT5400 Series\\nT5500 Series\\nT5600 Series\\nT5700 Series\\nT5800 Series\\nT5900 Series\\nT6500 Series\\nFV500 Series\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from, the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you\\'ll know when they\\'re calling without picking up the handset.\\n\\nTalking caller ID is great too. No more rushing to find the phone only to discover it\\'s a sales pitch or a call that could wait.\\n\\nI set this phone up on a voice over IP cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear. \\n\\nThe phone is running next to an 802.11b/g wireless computer network and has NO interference at all. \\n\\nOne suggestion to make the batteries last longer: Do NOT leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time. This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays \"recharge\" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You\\'ll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when I ran across these on a website. I was a little hesitant at first because I don\\'t think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don\\'t let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.\\n\\nI started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn\\'t believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumps!\\n\\nIf you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you. If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector, these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these, I would have paid much more than I actually did\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don\\'t think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\\n\\nOn the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I\\'ve ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB\\'s ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n\\' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\\n\\nIt should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB\\'s a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \\n\\nIn terms of build, the EB\\'s superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM\\'s (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB\\'s don\\'t extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB\\'s.\\n\\nOh, and some people think that the EB\\'s look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB\\'s stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\\n\\nLike all of the UE IEM\\'s in this series, the EB\\'s are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM\\'s, cord tangling.\\n\\nIt\\'s unlikely that the EB\\'s will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB\\'s are well-designed and definitely fun\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nwe have this for our 30gb ipod and it works fine in both our cars.....very handy and a must buy!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the 2nd Gamepad I\\'ve owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4-button + D-Pad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system, plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted, etc.\\n\\nI love this controller.  I\\'ve had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I\\'ve only used it in NFS games (I have them all).\\n\\nThe WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.\\n\\nThe rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFS-MW is very slight but that\\'s not the controllers fault, it\\'s a matter of programming by EA Games.\\n\\nI like the weight of the controller.  It\\'s not feather light, so with that motor and battery weight added, it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it - canadian dollars).  I didn\\'t like how my gravis gamepad as so light, so this is a step up.\\n\\nThe analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for non-slip action.  I am used to the D-Pad, so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don\\'t have time during a race to press a button before switching.\\n\\nIt works as well as my old gamepad, but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA, you\\'ll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nIt\\'s not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\nI\\'m very satisfied overall and I knew I may have to get used to the way it feels when I hold this controller since changing from the old SNES style Gravis Gamepad.\\n\\n4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe have had this phone for almost a year and I love it. We have the base station which is also an answereing machine  plus we have  a sattelite phone.  I wish we had more satelite phones.  I love the talking feature because I just listen and know who is calling. I also love the programming feature.  I never have to look aup a tel number that I call regularly anymore. I just wish the extra phones were not so expensive to add on. \\nGreat phone buy it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe system worked out of the box allowing me to quickly link up additional devices in an in-home office which had a single network connection. Haven\\'t measured simultaneous throughput to multiple computers yet, but from simple observation connectivity seems transparent.

Its a great design, tons of features, MP3 ring ton, Picture Caller ID, Sync with your PC for phone book, Answering machine, etc.\\nI am very happy with.\\nThank you so much for such great product with a great price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words, I don\\'t talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don\\'t use speaker phone features. Let\\'s just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn\\'t care less about.\\n\\nThis phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\\n\\nThe screen is attractive. A big step up from back-lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.\\n\\nI like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute, adjust volume, and page through your caller history.\\n\\nThe belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.\\n\\nI know many 5.8 GHz phones don\\'t mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don\\'t know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing\\'s for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\\n\\nOne other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it\\'s nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin\\' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.\\n\\nFinally, I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone\\'s screen displays the time.\\n\\nSo far I\\'ve found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I\\'ve owned\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this for my kids computer when I bought a new one for hubby and myself... these speakers sound better then the more expensive ones I have.... \\n  \\n I highly recommend these speaker\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\ni wanted a top quality palm with the bells and whistles.  this is pretty close to it but i had a few problems with the email and web features.  granted i am not a techie, but connecting and checking email should be more straightforward.  all the other features are top notch and overall i love my palm\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this item for a long trip so I could charge and/or play my Zen mp3 player in the car without worrying about battery life on the trip. It worked great. I am also planning to use it for my notebook in the car the same way because the car adapter for my notebook costs $100\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can\\'t beat that price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor the price is is great.\\nit\\'s working fine but the plastic is not solid and has a feeling of low quality. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI thought that this flash drive was above average in performance. Works well between a Macintosh and a PC. I liked the feature--missing from my last flash drive--of easily emptying the drive after use without having to some fancy erasing techniques. In other words, the PNY worked like a real hard drive. I would like the manufacuters to explain in detail how to attach the tread to the laniard. It took me a while to figure it out\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWith so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market, it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I\\'m not an Apple-white drone).  The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.  Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes.  Power cord is plenty long and I like the fact I can easily move the thing to a different room if I need music there\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWell, the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock.  Its VERY simple. just put your ipod on there and ROCK OUT TO THE BEAT. The bose quality is very obvious, and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it, which brings me to my next point. ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. my recomendation is to buy an FM transmitter and listend to your ipod on any Fm raido.  The only disadvantage of an Fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod, and its slightly easier(but thats what iPod is all about, isnt it...?)\\n\\nBasically, im saying buy it if you have a lot of mone\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m a jogger, and like to listen to All Things Considered while I run miles and miles. This radio is great because the light weight is unobtrusive. It has a convenient \"lock\" button to prevent accidentally changing the station with a bump. I previously had a similar size unit from Aiwa, this Sony has MUCH MUCH better reception\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis works well, allows you to view imported photos, but it is a slow proccess best left for the hotel room.

I bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of Kodak\\'s photo quality glossy from Costco.  My prints were blotchy.  Then I got my hands on some of Canon\\'s Photo Paper Pro, and my pictures were magically crystal clear.  The difference is amazing.  I never would\\'ve thought paper would make this much difference.  I\\'ve since bought Canon\\'s 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don\\'t care much about the quality of the output, while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis stick is fantastic for high resolution photos and is lightning quick. Do you need the extra speed the MSX-M1GN gives you? Maybe, maybe not. But at least you have it when and if you need the feature. Highly recommend it for the money. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThose people giving these speakers low reviews because they don\\'t have enough bass are idiots.  I don\\'t know what people expect of these little speakers, but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do.  These are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels; from Paris to camping in Northern California.  I cannot imagine going everywhere without them.  They are not  equivalent to a $10k stereo system, but they are not meant to be.  All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers.  Do not listen to the other reviews, these speakers will make a decent stereo of your MP3 player.  Enjoy them anywhere\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have used VoSKY Skype Call Center (USB07051C-01) for about a year now as my only home Skype In phone (paying $3.16 a month) after getting rid of Verizon (for which I was paying $50.00 a month).\\n\\nPROS\\nIt works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone.\\nEasy to set up.\\n\\nCONS\\nOnce in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the Vosky software and start again.\\nYou need a computer.\\n\\nIn summary good value for money and the best way to use Skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like Skype Wi-Fi phones Netgear and Belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out; or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAlthough I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever, I will try to address the issue at hand, and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.\\n\\nAs far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn\\'t give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can\\'t seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.\\n\\nSo despite the downfalls that I mentioned above, there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.  I simply love it, I just wish those other issues never happened\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWell, actually I bought this nice cable, at Amazon Marketplace great offering that it was, for an HDTV Tuner, which bombed in my neighborhood.

I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub-woofer) I decided for this not-as-portable model.\\nWell, these are perfect to keep on your desktop (though the ideal placement of any sub-woofer is on the floor close to a corner), as it has a small sized sub-woofer all controls in one the speakers.\\n\\nThese speakers sound really nice, slightly superior sound to Creative\\'s corresponding model (SBS 350) but with less output power (Creative\\'s SBS 350 sub-woofer is larger and more powerful)\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Headphone jack and POWER button in the left speaker\\n- No \"wired remote\" (which adds more clutter to your desktop)\\n- Nice design for the price\\n- Even cheaper than Creative\\'s SBS 350\\n\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Small sub-woofer\\n- No \"wired remote\" which means you have to keep one of the speakers close.\\n- No bass control (which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought one of these to replace the standard 32MB card that came with my camera. Wow, now I can store a ton of pictures. The price on the EP Memory cards are awesome too\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have the Quest 2, but I\\'ve heard that this also fits the Quest. I bought it because, while my Dell laptop backpack is well padded, I wanted to make sure that my Quest 2 GPS was protected \"just in case\". This case fits perfectly, literally like a glove. When I got it, I was sceptical; it looked to small, but I was wrong; the dimensions are perfect. And there is more than enough padding to protect the GPS from harm, yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket, which I sometimes have to (late day meetings where I leave my backpack at work). All in all, it\\'s another great product from Garmin\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years. It keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn. The barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt. I wash them down each year and they are like new. The fans I have now are on their third barn year. In a normal house I\\'m sure they would last forever. They are a little noisy, but the horses don\\'t care\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount.  I don\\'t know what the \"feet\" of the base is made of, but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F-250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it\\'ll stay there.  Occasionally, on long or \"bouncy\" trips, it\\'ll creep out of position a couple inches and I\\'ll have to move it back.  I\\'ve seen some comments complaining of that - but I don\\'t see it as a problem since common sense says it won\\'t stay perfectly still since it isn\\'t bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.\\n\\nMy wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I don\\'t recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got the dash mount because a friend recommended it.  I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also, there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to \"mold\" to fit the surface of the dash.  However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.  Anyway, it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when I stop, thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is my first HOTAS, but I did a good bit of research.  It is very easy to set up, and the SST Programming is very helpful setting the shift key.  The joystick is easy to move, which is nice in a close dogfight.  I am very glad that I bought this HOTAS, because I have had NO problems with it.  I highly recommend this system to anyone\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\n...for a surge protector.  But as far as I can tell, it\\'s doing its job.  Plus it looks kind of neat\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming &amp; marching.  This is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice.  This is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades.  The drum is a bit heavy,large, cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is LOUD.  The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set.  If you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans, spoil him/her with this first-class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI found this as the perfect solution to fill in some dead airt space in my house downstairs given the internet connection is upstairs and so far, other wireless solutions have been marginal. I really wondered if the Ethernet over powerlines would really work or if the 802.11G would really work. \\n\\nSo I get my new Extender kit, unbox it and plug everything in without bothering to read the directions. Lets be real, this stuff SHOULD be plug and play and IT WAS. It came right up and worked and has worked for the past three months flawlessly. I have decent range downstairs, it works with the Macs and the PCs and doesnt seem to care a whit. I can highly recommend using this product as the primary connection or as I did, extending an existing network without having to pull cable or put in multiple 802.11 bridges\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had no problems with my Mini Cruzer USB flash drive.

The smaller-than-a-small-filet-mignon gps device talks via bluetooth to your 650, which attaches to your windshield via a well-engineered holster.  The charger charges \\'em both, or not, as you see fit.  The instructions are clear and to the point.  The installation instructions are slightly out of date - you don\\'t need a card reader to make it happen, after all - and the user experience is, in my case, outstanding.  If you\\'ve got a 650 and you ever drive somewhere unfamiliar, BUY IT\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhen I purchased this product a couple weeks ago I wanted to make sure this purchase was worthwhile.  I studied many other speaker stands and it just didn\\'t seem I would have been getting the same quality. \\n\\nI received this pair a few days ago and originally thought they may be a little complicated to put together.  They only took about twenty minutes to assemble and put my cube speakers on.  The stands look great and go well with the cube speakers.

This Acer 19\" LCD makes me happy I did!\\n\\nMostly using my computer for gaming and movies the color, brightness, and size of the screen really matters to me. This monitor really nails all three of those areas. It provides vivid, crisp colors; it doesn\\'t wash out the picture with super-brightness (what my old monitor did), nor is its display too dark to catch the action; and the 19\" screen seems to have the perfect balance of immense screen size yet incredibly low desk size\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMonster has went over the top on this THX component video cable.

I was really impressed by the quality of the pictures rendered on that paper by my printer.  When the paper ran out I looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive - on the order of 40 cents per page.  Since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a letter-sized sheet of paper, that comes to about 20 cents per print, not counting the cost of ink.  Finally I stumbled upon this paper - Epson S041727 - and the price per print was around 12 cents, which rivals the cheapest Internet photo printing services I\\'ve found.\\n\\nIf you print a lot of 4x6 pictures, this is a great value for a great product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nHands down Epson Paper is the best photo paper on the market.\\nAt this price its a no brainer.A++++++++++\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis adapter is functional, is easy to use, enables continued use of backlight, and saves the batteries for walking with the eMap after arriving in a strange town.

It even comes with a mouse if you prefer to use that instead of the pen. Plugs right into your USB drive and works almost instantly\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this to illuminate the keyboard on my 12\" Apple Powerbook when I work in the dark.  It works well, and shines impressively bright and wide.  I even use it to read by simply sitting it on its back on my lap as I read in bed and pointing the lamp at my book.  It\\'s too bad the lamp\\'s arm isn\\'t telescopic or it\\'d make for a perfectly good clip-on booklight right out of the box.\\n\\nThis device is well built, folds into a form that protects it from damage, even when thrown in a laptop case full of stuff that might crush something built less solidly.

Satellite aquisition under the trees did not happen the few times I tried.  The display is excellent under sunny conditions.  Downloading waypoint data into a text file was simple.  I haven\\'t used it yet under driving conditions, so I can\\'t speak to using related features.

With HP black ink cartridge #21, it is very convient, and easy to setup into your HP deskjet 3930 series printer. This cartridge is very inexpensive, and affordable for HP printers. I think of it as a must for your HP printers. While there are cartridges that are difficult to open, and install into your printers, this one installs in a snap. I really recommend this for my new HP printer, and so will you if you own a HP printer for this ink as well.\\n\\nPrice: B\\n\\nConvience: B+\\n\\nOverall: B 1/2+\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt works with all my devices, it has several outputs for your different devices, no complain with it...\\n\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nSo far it has been terrific.

It is better than my big stereo.\\nNapster doesn\\'t do this mp3 however\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nLet\\'s just say I am 39 and holding and have wanted an MP3 for years. My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD\\'s, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn\\'t need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I\\'m sure 1000 songs will hold me. \\n\\nI looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.\\n\\nThe case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. \\nI got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! \\nI really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. \\nI also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. \\nPeople are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!\\nI think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWell the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price, and Amazon.com has beaten every on-line price I have seen. As for the toner itself, Hewlett Packard toner is top. I buy this product for two  reasons, 1. It\\'s what fits in my printer, and 2. I know when I buy the  C3906A, I am getting what I payed for, a quality cartrige that lasts. One  last note, twords the end of the cartrige life, a small line appears in the  content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply  shake the cartrige, reorder, and by the time the new one arrives, the old  one is finished\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m not much of a techie.  But, I do have lots of documents and pictures that I can\\'t bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day.  \\n\\nI used to back up my most important files on CD: an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple CDs and lots of time.  But, with this 2GB flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize.  The files are copied over to the device quickly, and easily.\\n\\nThe 2 Gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive.  \\n \\nScanDisk even includes a \"Synch\" software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data.  (The software also helps you copy over your Outlook messages, folders, appointments, tasks, and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive.)  \\n\\nAlso, I can imagine that the use of the Synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine.\\n\\nPhysically, the unit is small, sleek with a case that feels substantial.  The retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use.  \\n\\nThis thing is great.  I only wish I\\'d started using it sooner. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI ordered the apple ipod shuffle sport case because I wanted something to protect my ipod from the elements and just general bumping and scraping.  It works great, and you can use your ipod without taking it out of the case.  I haven\\'t taken my ipod out of the case except to charge it, or to change my playlist.  It\\'s a \"must have item\"  for anyone with an ipod shuffle\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAfter reading the Dec. \\'04 review in Computer Pilot I ordered it. Fine tuning is a bit involved but repetition makes the curve easier. Configuring from one a/c type throttle to another is easy with the downloadable manager from CH prod.

I wasn\\'t expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.

I really needed a two-line phone that wasn\\'t 2.4Ghz.\\n\\nThe first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn\\'t know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \\n\\nNext I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It\\'s a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it\\'s simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it\\'s answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn\\'t have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We\\'re so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it\\'s not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\\n\\nThe Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic\\'s phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn\\'t work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\\n\\nThe 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It\\'s much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7.  Also, can\\'t name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI love my new Monster FM Transmitter! It\\'s very easy to use and the reception is great\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBesides all opion regarding this new calculator, I would like to say, it is very nice, good design, options, features, a huge screen and modern color. So far, I haven\\'t navigate deep inside it, it is not similar as 48GX, so you\\'ve got to expend some time to know how to use it. I bought it since there is not a better calculator than this (48GX is UNIQUE but obsolete\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nEasy to install, gret price and now I have surround sound on my PC. woowho\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI thought I was going to have to try to track down some headphones for kids until I ran across these!  They are super comfortable and seem to block the world out.  I\\'ve been using them for about 3 months now and couldn\\'t be happier eventhough I\\'ve got a healthy dose of ear wax building up on them\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis isn\\'t my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don\\'t underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you\\'ll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you\\'ve got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don\\'t have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can\\'t tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.\\n\\nAn unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won\\'t have a heart-attack. Its doesn\\'t hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you\\'ll want more than this player anyway. \\n\\nThe best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3\\'s and wma. It won\\'t play AAC but if most of your music is this format you\\'ll better off with an ipod.\\n\\nThis would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. \\n\\nI\\'m giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI decided to purchase this item because I needed to get SD memory for my g/friends digital camera, so I chose this one because of the price and the brand. SanDisk is known for their memory. Well, no need to say more, this thing works great. I will buy another one but with more space anyday. Thanks alot San Disk\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\njust got this one at sears, and was only $20 so i grabbed it. the Canon A400 i have only came with 16mb so i needed more space. the 128 is much faster and easy to format than my old one. love it!!! go out and buy one today! GET SANDISK NOT LEXAR, THEY BREAK ALL THE TIME!!!!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nHow many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  \\n\\nThe SanDisk SDSDB-128-A10 Secure Digital 128MB, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.\\n\\nI truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIf you buy this service plan, print out the contract (found at the top of this page) and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\\n\\nSome notes on the contract:\\n1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I\\'m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\\'s warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn\\'t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don\\'t cover accidents and they don\\'t cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\\n\\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN\\'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don\\'t hold me liable since I don\\'t have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\\n\\nAssuming they aren\\'t jerks with their discretion and aren\\'t too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn\\'t get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThere is absolutely nothing that we don\\'t like about these Panasonic phones.  The sound quality is excellent as is the range.  Very happy customers\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had mine for a week. I had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years, which was misplaced. I bought the navigation kit at the same time I ordered a 60 CS. It makes what I bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies. I had no problems loading software and maps, upload or download from/to my gps.\\n\\nI am impressed by the softwares ability to \"recalculate\" in navigation mode. If I ignore the suggested route, it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where I am.\\n\\nI am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc. are concerned but I am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained. I have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example (to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane), and knowledge of one-way streets etc.\\n\\nThe real test is yet to come to negotiate San Francisco\\'s endless no left turns, one way streets, construction and limited freeway on ramps!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThree months later, I\\'m still amazed at how cheap this amazing piece of hardware was. Granted, it doesn\\'t vibrate, nor have a zillion buttons, but it definitely performs admirably. It is comfortable and the buttons respond well. The unit feels well-built, and connects to the computer easily via USB. And as a bonus, it looks pretty too. :\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this based on the overall positive reviews.  Good sound quality, and a comfortable fit.  I didn\\'t find them to be too tight at all.  For a low-end pair of headphones, I think they\\'re pretty impressive\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe cups of these heaphone are a little small and they do fit snuggly on my head but after stretching them out a bit I must say they are very comfortable. If you dont like them at first wear them for a while, they will grow on you.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIf you went to circuit city, you would see this is $30 there. Here its only 8.99! With fast shipping I only paid about $16 total, half the price of circuit city. Those type of stores (best buy, circuit city, compusa) are a total ripoff when it comes to these cables. Buy from Amazon.com (eektech will ship) and you save lots of $$. Thanks eek for great service\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWorks great, good quality from Belkin as usual. Hard to beat for the money\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m using the product as I respond to this request for a review.  Sufficiently compact for ease of packing in my laptop case.  No technical issues (so far).  Tracking is excellent.  Has worked flawlessly under daily working conditions.  Recommend highly\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis mouse works perfectly fast and easy without problems even if you don\\'t install the software.\\nIf you need a cordless mouse this is what you have to bu\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAs the title states, this is an excellent wireless mouse.  Works right away with Windows XP, no driver install or software needed for two-button and normal scroll capabilities.  Software allows for extra button assignment, but could use some work.  I have had some trouble finding the menus I want when I want to find them.  For example, I have an issue where I cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the USB receiver after a system start-up, however I am able to find those menus in the software if I remove and reinsert the receiver.\\nBut as I said before, superb mouse function and tracking...this thing works on upholstery, leather, my jeans, and thick carpet!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn\\'t get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn\\'t weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn\\'t fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don\\'t like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn\\'t a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhen I purchased this product I was a little sceptical, however, once I unpacked it and started using it, it was so absolutely easy to use, and the pictures have such a fine quality, and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection.  So, I see it as a win/win product.  The only draw back is the weight and size. I just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFirst and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can\\'t comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.\\n\\nThat being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.\\n\\nSo why four stars?  Well, for a few reasons:\\n\\n--Only available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I\\'d have liked to match it.\\n\\n--No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn\\'t disconnect so easily from the Nano that I\\'d fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.\\n\\nFor this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn\\'t the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.\\n\\n--NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano!  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only!\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners\\' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\\n\\nAll in all, I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt\\'s been through the wringer, and has had no problems after about a year. I came here looking for a replacement cap, but can\\'t find one on Amazon\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI downloaded the driver from Trendnet\\'s website before installing the adapter. I did not encounter any problems at all, including the issue that some users had with it disconnecting when they plugged in another USB device\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they\\'ll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I\\'ve been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I\\'ve always been satisfied with merely \"decent\" audio.  Until now.\\n\\nI\\'d previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that\\'s now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it\\'s time to rip everything into lossless format.\\n\\nI cannot recommend these headphones more highly - they are simply extraordinary.  When your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality, though, life\\'s going to get a lot more expensive, as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation.\\n\\nStill, this is a bloody miracle.  My ears have finally been opened.  Wow\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nHaving been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nEach time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600\\'s, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP\\'s. The difference in sound going \\'lower\\' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \\n\\nWhether you use Sennheiser\\'s merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600\\'s ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600\\'s give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\\n\\nThe reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70\\'s all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called \\'\\'Economy Class Beatles\\'\\' George Harrison\\'s and Ringo Starr\\'s albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600\\'s reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD\\'s still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more \\'round\\' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600\\'s make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600\\'s are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to \\'\\'Take IT Away\\'\\' from 1982\\'s Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to \\'silence\\' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \\n\\nIt gets much worse than \\'Take It Away\\' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it\\'s just too bad the rest of the album doesn\\'t sound as good as that one song.\\n\\nWhen you listen to your CD\\'s, vinyl, DVD\\'s in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you\\'ve spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney\\'s JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600\\'s, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \\n\\nCan I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I\\'m trying to prove a point doesn\\'t it.\\n\\nAlbums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600\\'s. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70\\'s and 80\\'s when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\\n\\nIsao Tomita\\'s The Firebird (1976)\\nGeorge Harrison\\'s eponymous album (1979)\\nSteely Dan\\'s Gaucho (1980)\\nJoe Walsh\\'s The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get (1973)\\n10CC\\'s The Original Soundtrack (1975)\\nGodley &amp; Creme\\'s Consequences (1977)\\nSupertramp\\'s Crime of the Century (1974)\\nXTC\\'s Black Sea (1980)\\nPeter Gabriel\\'s 3rd album (1980)\\nKate Bush\\'s The Dreaming (1982)\\nEarth Wind and Fire\\'s All \\'n\\' All (1977)\\nLevel 42\\'s The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)\\nBilly Cobham\\'s Spectrum (1972)\\nFrank Zappa\\'s One Size Fits All (1975)\\nRingo Starr\\'s Goodnight Vienna (1974)\\n\\nand a truly incredible sounding album from the 90\\'s, Prince and The New Power Generation\\'s \\'\\'Symbol\\'\\' album from 1992.\\n\\nAlbums NOT HD-600 friendly:\\nTodd Rundgren\\'s Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)\\nBlue Oyster Cult\\'s Agents of Fortune (1976)\\nPaul McCartney\\'s Venus and Mars (1975 - and quite a few others)\\nJohn Lennon\\'s Imagine (1971 - and avoid 1970\\'s Instant Karma like the plague, the piano track will hurt you . .  )\\nYes\\'s Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)\\n\\nand surprisingly enough, many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain\\'t broken.  \\n\\n\\nIf you have to save up for a pair, or do some heavy searching for HD-600\\'s that are affordable, do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed, especially when I kept up with their pace.\\n\\n\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI just purchased one of these and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews that stated how difficult it was to load the information into the unit. I had no problem at all. In fact it was quite simple. I am truly amazed at how acurate and easy to use this unit is. For the price, you can\\'t beat it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought the Transcend 1 GByte card for my PDA. My Axim x51v immediately recognized it and is working flawless for the past few weeks. I am planning to get the 4GB model too which is currently retailing for $90 to $110 elsewhere.\\n\\nHar\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was mislead with Amazon review which said it supports conversion to MP3 format with the software supplied, it does not. The help quite clearly states \"You cannot convert a file into an MP3 file\". It will convert to .wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to MP3.\\n\\nIf it had MP3 support (at least conversion on the PC from the Sony proprietary format which is .msv) I would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible. It you record in full quality mode (1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing. The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.\\n\\nBut it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion. Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space.\\n\\nBut I would buy one again, as it is very easy to use, small, and very high quality. I just hope Sony would listen to consumers and support MP3\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the same cartridge I can purchase elsewhere, but cheaper.  It works well in our printer with no issues whatsoever and my HP printer prints fantastic photos when I use HP ink and HP premium photo paper\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNo complaints - I\\'m pleased with the quality and price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBefore I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website, \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was, I didn\\'t like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\\n\\nIt was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It\\'s very simple.\\n\\nI am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn\\'t fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I\\'m perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\\n\\nIf you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I\\'m sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there\\'s a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer\\'s \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\\n\\nOverall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe HP12C has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years. I bought my first one when I was a consultant and it lasted until August 2006. It withstood all the travel and constant use well. I use it for simple and complex math; statistical analysis and financial analysis. It is much faster and simpler to operate than a PC. My new one has all the same great features. I highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn\\'t work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse. \\nAnother nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a great printer.  I have used it several times and it makes great pictures.  I had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great.  Tried this on a regular printer and the print didn\\'t look near as great.  A great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have.  You can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards.\\n\\nColors are great and vivid.  Also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop.  I have not tried printing to non Epson paper so I can\\'t say how prints would look.  I know that Epson printers look the best printed on Epson paper. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe camers is good in picture quality and easy to install and use. It\\'s multi utility for desktop and notepad is a very good feature which I personally expected. I have a complete satisfaction\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAlthough the rear speakers need a power plug, this system solved my problem of being unable to run a signal wire to the back speakers from the front. The sound is OK, not awesome, but not bad. Better than the TV speakers by a long shot. They can also be nicely controlled with my Harmony remote\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nvery good, worth the money. If you want a louder one, go for Z 535\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNever been game player much since pong-Purhcased BF2 last December for the PC and loved it. Flying was limited though-util I purchased my G7 from NE and have been enjoying MUCHO fast speeds, easily adjusted, and for internet parusing it has a built in back button. Have to change out battery every two days but gives plenty of warning and is always charged when I need to replace. Absolutely the best mouse I have ever owned.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI love this keyboard. \\nAfter searching through just about every keyboard available, I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I\\'m so glad that I chose this one.\\nIt is excellent! The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It\\'s a great keyboard for gaming, office use, media or just ordinary, everyday use.\\nThey keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool, but I don\\'t use it much. It\\'s better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though.\\nI really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files, e-mail or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don\\'t like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can\\'t see any way to reasign it. However, it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard.\\nAside from all of that, how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it.\\nTo top it off, it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have been into MP3s since 1996 - I used winplay, and l3enc, and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere - Africa, Europe, My living room.  \\n\\nAfter about 70,000 hours of use and abuse, it finally died.  \\n\\nI needed a replacement, so I looked at iPod, and Zune, but why would I stray from Creative Labs?  Besides, it\\'s better in every way - better screen than the ipod, better interface than the Zune, and a better battery than either one.\\n\\nWhen I plugged it into my computer, I was blown away.  XP found the player, and without any drivers or proprietary (think iTunes) software, I was able to drop my non-DRM ;) mp3 files right onto the generous space available.  I was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything, or ever being forced to reboot my PC.  I transferred a couple of movies and I\\'m looking forward to my next flight\\n</review_text>]'"

So far it has worked fine, though I don\\'t pretend to be an expert digital photographer. When the card is empty, it shows 127 shots available.

I\\'ve had it now for about a month and have gotten lots of use out of it and it has loosened up a little, but not much.  There has got to be a way to make a lid that stays on, but isn\\'t quite so hard to remove when a person wants to use it.  I appreciate being provided with a forum to voice my opinion\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWorks well with or without software installed.  Good for home use and school or traveling.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis technically works well.  I am finding learning to use it difficult.  I really wish I had spent a little more and gotten a bigger one!!!!!

I was originally hesitant to buy the graphire line because I didnt think it would be very good for drawing compared to the top line (the intuos line).  I was pleasantly surprised to be proven wrong.  Installing a driver was a piece of cake and I began drawing away in minutes.  It is very responsive and works with all my drawing programs (paintshop pro, painter, photoshop).  The mouse is pretty useless however, and I would have preferred if they had included some extra pen tips instead (they seem to wear out, though I do press pretty hard).  Other than that, its an amazing product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nGreat value for your money. Kingston has always been a reliable memory chip company and the same goes for this product.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nGreat batteries for cameras.

The product description was a bit confusing as it seems like ti does a lot.  But what a surprise.   Just adjusting the brush size using the ipod like scroll disc on the device is worth the price.  The pop-up menu thing is cool.  I don\\'t use it as much for putting tools, but putting my files and folders into that menu keeps things in one place.   I guess the product also lets you pan and zoom around, but I don\\'t seem to use that as much.  I still like using my mouse to pan and zoom around.\\n\\nHey, I was skeptical about the product like anyone else, but  found myself a rare surprise.  Good job Logitech\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve had this product for well over a year now and was using it with my XP machine and am now using it with my Apple Mac Mini.

Highly recommended\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have burnt a few discs and so far no coasters, They are burning at 8X in my NEC 2500A burner.

Now I keep one at home, and take one with me when I go LANning.  The only issue with the keyboard is the LCD is pretty useless is fast paced FPS games, otherwise it\\'s good for keeping the clock up so one doesn\\'t lose track of the time\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m very happy with the set.  Although not listed in the specs, it must have a QAM tuner, because I am able to watch unscrambled digital broadcasts through my cable service even though all I have is basic cable.  I was thrilled when I made this discovery.  Watching football games in HD, without paying for digital cable, almost made me weep with happiness.\\n\\nThe picture quality for analog channels is only so-so.  I really wish the remote was illuminated.  Also, Amazon took much longer to deliver the TV than was promised.  Other than these negatives, I\\'m very happy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMy new TV finally arrived and I am very pleased with it.  I picked this one based primarily on all of the reviews I could find online, the vast majority of which were very positive (cNet has lots of reviews as well).  Also, I have two friends who are cable guys and they see all kinds of TVs, all day every day, and both of them bought this exact set for themselves.\\n\\nMy cable provider does not offer many High Def stations yet so the image quality of Standard Def video was the primary criterion for me.  Most reviews were very positive in this regard but there were some that were the exact opposite.  My first impression had me rather worried.  I have since come to believe that poor quality Standard Def video is just a matter of garbage in = garbage out.  I began to suspect this when I noticed that some stations looked much better than others.  In fact, some shows and commercials on any given station looked much better than those which preceded or followed them.  I became convinced as I watched a cable news show where the host and two contributors were each on different cameras being displayed at the same time.  The video of the host looked OK, the video of one contributor was poor, and the video of the other contributor looked great.  The video quality of the various individuals remained consistent when they were occasionally displayed individually on the entire screen.  The set certainly has the ability of displaying fantastic Standard Def video.  I expect that I just never noticed the variability of video quality on lesser TVs.\\n\\nThe quality of the Hi Def Video is breath taking.\\n\\nSet-up was simple and I have not even bothered yet to read the manual.  Of course the display can be adjusted in many ways, but it looks good to me with the factory presets and I do not intend to adjust the display anytime soon.  Flipping through the on screen menu, I stumbled across the altitude setting which was a nice surprise since I live at 10,000 ft. above sea level.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed with the delivery situation.  I thought I had ordered the TV in time to have it by opening day kick-off.  Instead it arrived just in time for the third weekend of the football season, and I was told that it could easily have been another week beyond that.  I blame the shipper (Eagle USA) for this, not Amazon.  I say this because I could track the package enough to know that Amazon had the TV picked up right away.  But then Eagle USA kept it sitting in Dallas for almost 2 weeks, and then in Denver for another week, before finally calling me to arrange for delivery.  I believe that if I had not called and emailed Amazon to complain about the delay, it would have taken longer.  Eagle USA told Amazon that they had tried to call me sooner but I know that this is not true for two reasons: 1) I had called Eagle USA the same day they told Amazon this and Eagle USA told me that they had no intention of calling me until a day or so prior to delivery, and 2) my livelihood depends on people being able to reach me at all times and I have a very good message and caller ID tracking system in place.\\n\\nAll in all, a great set at a great price, I just wish I had ordered and started pushing the issue sooner\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nSo, I was a little weary to buy an iTrip after hearing some mixed reviews. It seemed that a perosn either had horrible luck with theirs... or the iTrip worked perfectly. Knowing my luck, it wouldn\\'t work for me at all. I recieved my iTrip and my luck started right away. I tossed the iTrip onto my iPod and..................... nothing. A bad omen? Well, after I exchanged my iTrip for a new one I tried it out on a short drive. I live in East Lansing, MI... and we have a very crowded FM dial. I couldn\\'t find a completely blank station as recommended... but it didn\\'t matter. My iTrip delivered decent sound through the station. As others have mentioned, charging your iPod while you use your FM transmitter will really help. It\\'s not a night-and-day difference, but it\\'s a noticeable improvement. Sure, I got some static and the occasional interference from a strong signal, but you know what? Through a good 40 minutes of driving, the majority of the time I had satisfactory sound. This was also on the weaker-signaled LX mode, not DX. Supposedly DX provides a better, stronger signal. \\nThis product is dependant on several outside factors. The reception your car gets and the availability of a clear FM channel. To rate this product poorly because of factors out of it\\'s control is unfair. There were times when I had downright poor sound... and times where it was comparable to a tape deck. I love good, crisp sound as much as anyone does... but I\\'ll take somewhat degraded sound over trying to find good music on the radio anyday. \\n\\nMy recommendation after owning this product for a short time *but it has been used quite a bit already, as I do a lot of driving*, I say: If you can, buy a tape deck adaptor... but if it\\'s not an option and you don\\'t want to put the money into an \"ipod to car\" setup, this is a viable solution indeed. In my opinion, an iTrip is a better option than listening to plain, old radio.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have used the 9510i for about 2 years and have found it to be flawless in performance. The Disaster Recovery software provided with this drive is it\\'s biggest star. You can format your hard drive, put in the restore disk that you create for your system, and in about 15 minutes your system is put back to EXACTLY the way it was when you created the disk. Or you can simply replace selected files if you want. It does not miss a single thing. Fanstastic. The software is extremely user friendly and guides you through the process easier than an \"ABC\" book. I would highly recommend this drive for performance and ease of use\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNice sound, I will admitt for the price, I get big sound, with quality.  Only thing is a humming, hissing sound when machine is idle. Ohtherwise, worth it. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI,ve seen complaints about the ac adapter you \"must\" plug in. Hey guys, try it without an outside energy source, I just hope I,m not gonna fry something but it seems to work fine just plugged into a powered USB port. I have a VERY high end system though with wattage to sprare, but no more PCI slots, Damn 7900 512 gtx graphics cards, why do 2 of em have to take up so much room. Oh well, trade offs are a bi---, but a reality and 7 extra USB slots are awfully nice\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt\\'s a simple device, so there\\'s not to say about it other than it does the job. You should note that the LEDs on the device remain lit as long as the device is plugged into your PC and the PC is powered (they glow a bright blue).\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this TV for college, and it fits perfectly in my dorm. The picture quality is pretty decent, though compared to traditional TV, it is not as sharp.\\n\\nThe audio quality is very good. I was able to play Final Fantasy 12 with this TV, and the audio lives well for my expectations.\\n\\nNo lag while playing my Playstation 2 console...\\n\\nThe only downside is that if you want to switch from AV mode back to TV mode, you need to press \"SOURCE\" on the remote or the TV 4 times...and it\\'s annoying waiting for it...but besides that, it\\'s a very nice budget TV for anyone that wants a TV that can save you some money and space\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe used this charger with a DC inverter on a 6000 mile road trip to charge batteries for a Sony DSC-H5 camera and the batteries were almost unbelievable with lasting power between charges. The 2700mAh battery is great\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe intuos3 6x11 tablet is nice because its like having a giant mouse pad. The mouse itself has five buttons that can be programed to do different tasks, opening programs is one of them. It also has a scroll wheel. On the pad there are more buttons that can open programs among other things. Also there are touch sensitive strips on the tablet that can be used for scrolling. I use the pen inside of art progams and it is a real joy to work with. The pressure sensitivity is is a very nice feature alowing you to go from a thin line to a thick line and vice versa. Its main high point for me is the ability it gives to draw curved lines and detailed lines. It fits nicely in hand and has comfortable rubber grip. Also you can flip the pen over and use that side as an eraser. The only complaint I have is that on the pen there are two buttons and one of them (the lower one) is placed in a spot where when I\\'m drawing my finger frequently hits it, because of this I simply had to make the button inactive. Over all I feel that Wacom has done a very good job of developing this product. I feel that it is of high quality and well worth the price. I would definetly save up the extra few dollars to get this larger tablet, it is nice to have if you have the desk space. I\\'ve heard Wacom is the best in the pen tablet industry and now that I own one I believe it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFabulous product --- now I can store over 700 photos in the 8 mega pixel range.    Happy I purchased this one -- very trouble free\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI wouldn\\'t be without this. When I first bought the 20d it was my first digital SLR and I spent a few weeks adding and removing the battery grip and this strap. In the end I settled for using both and wouldn\\'t have it any other way. With the battery grip and hand strap in place I find the camera much more secure and comfortable to hold. That\\'s all there is to it, that\\'s what it does and it does it well. \\n\\nOn the down side, and it\\'s a small and transient down side, actually fitting it to the camera and getting it adjusted to the exact right length for your hand is a bit fiddly and you\\'d sort of expect it to be insecure. I think the trick, security wise, is to make sure the bottom strap goes through the center buckle first, then it is locked in by the top strap which is already held securely at the junction with the neck strap (if used). I also don\\'t like the attachment to the neck strap, I don\\'t like having a fairly sharp edged piece of metal where it can rub against the chasis of the camera in normal use.\\n\\nI use this on a 20d which typically has a 24-200 or 80-400 lens attached. You can only use this if you also use the battery grip, or buy a third party plate which attaches to the tripod mount and provides the lower mounting location. But since I always use the battery grip I don\\'t have an issue. \\n\\nIf Canon read this, you could do with a better solution for the attachment and adjustment on an accessory of this price, you normally pay close attention to detail and it\\'s a bit lacking here\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have bought 50 and 100 pack spindles of Memorex and so far I have not had any problems. They work just fine on my Sony dvd burner\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMemorex DVD+R\\'s are the best. Price keeps dropping and never have a problem\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have burned over 100 of these in the past 6 months, I have only had 1 burn badly.  Haven\\'t found a dvd player yet that they won\\'t play in\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is an excellent machine.  I bought two of them.  There are a few things you need to do.  I have had 100% satisfaction using FujiFilm DVD-R up to 8x.  I have had success with FujiFilm DVD+R up to 8x.  I`ve also had tremendous success with TDK DVD+R up to 4x and 8x.  Some other brands may not work.  One thing I`ve learned about this machine is that you have to baby it a little.  Don`t go recording 3 or 4 -R or +R DVDs every day.  Give it a rest between recordings.  One or two per day is okay.  Definitely give it room to breathe.  If you stack your machines on top of each other, put something in between so they can breathe.  Be sure not to block the ventilation holes on the sides.  You definitely need to buy a Panasonic DVD player to play back your DVDs - other brand DVD players may not play your recordings properly.\\n\\nOne of the greatest things about this machine is that it records DVD-RAM.  They are re-recordable for many, many times and each program can be erased when watched.  You can even edit the recordings on the DVD-RAM.  Cut out commercials and fit more on a disc or remove the commercials for when you watch the program.  Only works on the DVD-RAM.  I have over 50 DVD-RAM discs (Panasonic brand) - they sure take up less space than VCR tapes!\\n\\nGet one or two of these recorders and a Panasonic DVD player and you`ve got it made!  Throw away your VCRs forever!  Just remember to baby them\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this for my folks for Christmas.  It took no time at all to hook up, and making DVDs was simple.  Everything from recording off the TV, to recording movies and shows stored on the DVR, to transferring home movies from the original VHS tapes.  I\\'m sure for about $300 more you could purchase some higher end recorders, but for under $200, you really can\\'t go wrong.  The only flaw I could find is that the initial hookup (according to the book) didn\\'t seem quite right.  After taking a whole 2 minutes to look up the easy to read instructions online, everything went smoothly.

A $20 Cables to Go HDMI cable does a great job.  We have the  Sony KDF-42E2000 42\" 3LCD Rear Projection HDTV and are thrilled with the combination.  A few annoyances:  The machine responds and loads slowly, but that\\'s not too bad; a minor sacrifice for the incredibly low price.  And, certain DVDs of old movies (Some Like it Hot, The King and I) stretch the picture horizontally, making things look squat.  I\\'m sure there\\'s a solution, but just can\\'t figure it out.  Any tips\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVHS to DVD disc is just one easy setup. I set mine to record and recode just before I go to sleep. When I wake up a finished disc awaits. With the software tools that are provided you can sharpen and correct VHS that has degraded and bring back life as when it was first transfered to tape. I have taken many VHS tapes that were never released as DVD and now have the start of a great library. Editing is a little tricky until you get the hang of it. The product works well.

We have tried several brands trying to find the ones that last the longest. We have tried Energizer, Duracell, etc. She needs to replace them every day and a half.

Great, Great system\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve owned many Sony electronics in the past and have always liked their styling and functionality -- lots of hardy Walkmen, useful shortwave and portable radios, stylish TVs and high quality cassette recorders.  I still have a Sony mini component stereo model FH-E656 (made in Japan) which I bought in 1992 for US$400+; but rather than pay to fix its worn-out CD player, I decided to purchase this new Sony MHCEC70 component stereo (made in China).\\n\\nPLUSES: \\ndecent sound\\ngood functionality\\neasy set-up and intuitive operation\\nsimple remote -- but only covers basic functions\\n\\nCONS:\\nvery short speaker leads\\nunattractive styling (for my tastes) -- resembles a boombox\\nonly holds 3 CDs vs 5 for comparable Panasonic units\\n\\nAt first glance, I was disappointed by the cheap construction, skimpy manual and very short speaker leads -- the manufacturer seemed to be counting pennies.  But then I thought: in 2006 for $150, I can\\'t expect the same quality as I received in 1992 for $400.  Everything is made more cheaply now and almost all in China.  So, for the money, it suits my purposes as a nice sounding stereo unit for the bedroom.  The real test will be how long the CD changer works -- to be safe, this time I bought the 2 year replacement warranty.  I haven\\'t blasted it at full volume, but it seems to have plenty of power when needed.\\n\\nI originally bought a $300 Panasonic unit (SC-PM71SD MP3 SD Micro System) which was returned because it didn\\'t have the full data recording feature as advertised (data recording was crippled by DRM limitations).  This Sony stereo costs half as much, and has almost all the same functionality\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nA memory Stick is a s memory stick but when you put it in a Sony Camera - Fantastic\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis portable cd holder is perfect for me.

Took me about 10 minutes to set them up.)\\n\\nMajor modes of operation are:\\n\\n1. Wireless Access Point (its default set-up)\\n2. Wireless Client (connect a wired ethernet device via cable to the WAP54G and you now have a wireless ethernet device)\\n3. Wireless Repeater (extend range of wireless coverage)\\n4. Wireless Bridge (connect two ethernet networks without running a cable between them -- acts as one end of a \"virtual\" cable; you need two to get the job done)\\n\\nA pair of wireless bridges is just what I needed but hesitated to buy the WAP54G because of Brian\\'s comment that this wouldn\\'t work. Because of my newness to the wireless world it took a bit of investigation to come to the conclusion that Brian was wrong. I bought a pair and they do work.\\n\\nI rate it 4 instead of 5 stars for a few reasons.\\n\\n1. I understand that higher-end, more expensive, equipment can be had with more range than this box. Gotta leave some room to rate more powerful equipment!\\n2. One must dig very deeply into the users guide (a PDF on the CD) to find the default IP address in order to configure this device. Luckily I had read elsewhere what that IP address is (192.168.1.245). Other manufacturers make this info readily available, even going so far as printing it on the device itself. This will be critical info to any Linux user. Also, the users guide says that the default userid for logging in is \"admin\". Well, it\\'s not. The only allowed userid is an empty field. This had me going for a few minutes.\\n3. Something that 99% of the world won\\'t care about -- I like to have more access to the firmware. For example other Linksys products allow one to telnet to the box and do low-level analysis of the box and the network it\\'s attached to. I think there are third-party firmware loads that enable this\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\ni love the mobilemate sd.  I haven\\'t had any problems yet.

That person chose to buy it without and save some $$ and then complained about having to pay extra for it because he/she bought the wrong software package.  Delorme did the right thing and offered us options.  I just ordered mine and I have no plans on using with a HH so I\\'m very happy that I didn\\'t have to buy the HH software.  Just don\\'t be dumb and read what you are buying before you buy it.  Nemerous people have highly recommended this to me, although I have heard that MS Mappoint has better maps and should be used instead when you have it as an option.  Storing 50,000 data points without a connection to a computer is awesome.  I will be able to take the unit with me on a bike ride and analize the workout later hopefully looking at the route, elevation, etc.  Too bad it is only in Yellow..\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this jacket a month into having my ipod.  I had to buy it because I had been using the one that comes with the ipod and when I pulled the iPod out of that case it was easy to drop.  One time I did drop it and within a month of owning the iPod I had it in fro repairs.\\n\\nThis case protected my iPod of another 11 months just fine.  My complaint with it tough is the plastic peice that protects the screen and pod from falling out.  It is stiched on the inside so when the ipod is in there is creates friction.  Acrilic and plastic do not mux and you get a slightly scraped serface.\\n\\nIt will protect your pod though\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe product works perfectly.  The only problem is, the manual only includes directions for the most common setups.  To use one port as an \"uplink\" to a router, for example, you need to plug the uplink into the ethernet port labeled \"1\" and then leave port \"2\" open.  The directions do not state this, and I had to call Linksys to get it to work.\\n\\nOther than that, it is fast, reliable, and small.  Perfect\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMy setup:\\n- Dell Latitude PP01L (Intel chip)\\n- Win XP Pro\\n- D-Link DI-624 Wireless Router (with two walls inbetween the laptop and the antenna)\\n- Enabled the WEP feature\\n\\nI unplugged the old wireless card and simply plugged this in.  Windows found the new card and did its Plug-n-Play thing.  Not only was I was able to get on the Internet immediately, but the card picked up two other signals in the neighborhood that I couldn\\'t \\'see\\' with my 11MB/sec Cisco Aironet card.  This I sort of expected, but was still a bit surprised being that my closest neighbor is beyond the range of most wireless routers.\\n\\nThe CD installed just fine, but when I went to the D-Link site to check for an updated driver it said I was up-to-date.  I ran Windows Update and it claimed I had an updated driver available for my new D-Link card. I\\'ve never had a problem with D-Link\\'s website (or customer service, while we\\'re on the subject), so I was a bit taken aback that Microsoft was ahead of D-Link\\'s site.  \\n\\nEither way...  install the card and get onto the internet, then have Windows Update check for possible updates.\\n\\nBe sure to enable the encryption feature.  If you are running a small network of computers where you are sharing folders then you want to be sure that your neighbors can\\'t go snooping through your stuff.  Or worse, lift the signal, and ultimately your personal information.\\n\\nI\\'ve had no problems with my current set-up.  I HIGHLY recommend this card to bring your laptop/desktop up-to-date\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis review pertains specifically to the Targus PAUH217U 4 Port Ultra Mini USB 2.0 Hub. \\nThe cord is about 2.5 feet long - long enough to reach from my pc, which sits on the ground, to the top of the desk. It has a cable which is split into two USB plugs - one just to transmit data, the second to power the unit. The second plug does not need to be used unless you plan on using some heavy-duty hardware, and if so what are you buying a hub called the ultra mini for anyways? If you insist on trying to run a blow dryer off the thing, then it does have an input for a separate power source, which you will have to buy separately. \\n\\nIn short, If you have an old school machine with USB ports which are inaccessible /inconvenient to use, this little hub will give you quick access while taking up minimal space on your desk\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had read the reviews of this mouse prior to buying it.

Especially good for recording lectures, voice lessons, etc.  It works quite well with the built-in mono mike, or you could use an external one.\\n\\nOne of the few players that lets you record from a line input or an external mike -- you toggle which setting it is in the settings section.\\n\\nI record my radio shows by plugging in the line-out from the station\\'s tape deck to my iRiver.\\n\\nFor those who recorded live music with their MiniDiscs, it\\'s a little trickier.  You have to set the record input before -- you can\\'t change it on the fly.\\n\\nI\\'ve recorded live DJ shows with the built-in and AGC on.  Of course, the booming bass distorts horribly, but overall an easy record of the show.  Very easy to keep in a pocket rather than to be obviously recording a show.\\n\\nI\\'ve also tried external mikes with the record input turned down very low with very good results.  A bit of trial and error which I\\'m still refining with later iRiver products.\\n\\nThe single AA batter lasts a good long time.  Summer School involves 2, 2-hour classes, and I can record several days of them before battery is low.  If the battery runs out during recording, fear not, the file is saved!\\n\\nThe negatives are the requirement to go through the special iRiver music program, but there are now firmware updates that will change your iRiver into the typical USB external drag-and-drop drive.\\n\\nFiles are recorded in a .REC file which one then converts to a .mp3 file after transfer to your computer.  I don\\'t know how different this format is because it takes up exactly the same amout of space as the .mp3 file.  But you can\\'t trasnfer .mp3 files off your iRiver, even if you made them yourself, so don\\'t think you can use this to transfer .mp3 files from one computer to another.\\n\\nAlso, the molding where the line-in input is sometimes gets in the way of certain plugs such as some RCA to 1/8\" adaptors, so make sure you pick one that alows it to fit in securely all the way.\\n\\nI\\'ve had mine for just over a year now and use it every day, whether just playing mp3s or recording classes.  I\\'m only just starting to have some trouble with the on/off/play/pause button.  After so many presses, it\\'s starting to wear out.  But it\\'s still working reliably.  I just have to press a little more precisely and pay more attention.\\n\\nI have the 1G model (iFP-799) which is great.  I was able to record a 12-hour radio show marathon I produced with it.  Previous marathons required a stack of cassette tapes or minidiscs.\\n\\nI\\'m quite happy with iRiver and plan on buying from them in the future\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this for hubby and me over the summer.   We used it for our trip to Rehoboth beach and we loved every minute of it.   WE have a tape deck in the car and used it w/ a cassette adaptor.  We had not problems whatsoever, in fact it sounds much better thru the cassette adaptor than over the fm transmitter.   \\nI did try it thru the fm transmitter and it was a pain to switch from one station to the next, but i don\\'t think anybody can improve upon that.  I had the same problem w/ my itrip.  \\nWe chose sirius for several reasons...i liked the classic vinyl station, my dad introduced me to that and hubby likes nascar and this is switching over in 2007.\\nThe only problem i had was i couldn\\'t read the red lettering in the daylight w/ the sunglasses on, but i didn\\'t give them less than 5 stars because of this.  \\nthis is the way to go, plus it has a suction mount, not a permanent mount. \\nalso, if you look on ebay, someone is selling something to adapt your mount to the bolt on your car seat!!\\ndefinitely go satellite, the music is great and little/ no commercials depending on the stations.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWorks good, small, and comes with handy little stickers to put on so you can write contact info in case you lose it, though slightly costl\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this hub back in September.

In RAW mode, which I\\'m converting to thanks to this large capacity card, I am able to hold 444 images all on my 20D!!! If your thinking of buying this card, don\\'t hesitate.

I never had to try other pairs of earphone because I absolutely loved these that I keep buying it! After 6 years I buy the same one everytime. Of course I never use the winding case and it just sits there but heck it usually stores my other earphones that I brought but can\\'t seem to throw them out because it costed money. It seems that many people are complaining about the electrical shocks from the earphones and I can answer why thats happening. It\\'s actually static electricity. I experienced it myself a couple of times because I was wearing a wool sweater and the wool peacoat jacket that caused static electricity to form. It\\'s actually not the earphones fault but when your wearing lots of clothes or a scarf with the earphones I suggest you switch to headphones to prevent being shocked. The bass is pretty decent when comparied to panasonic or jvc earphones. Hey for 10 bucks or less you can\\'t except Sony to go all out and improve their cheapest model. I abuse my earphones so for 10 bucks a year I think these are the best rather than buying something thats $100 dollars or over and later regret it because it got either lost, broken or stolen.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAfter having two SanDisk card readers, and one LaCie card reader die on me, I invested in this Lexar card reader. For the money, it has worked flawlessy with Pro compact flash cards up to 4GB in size. I am very impressed with the transfer speeds, and the unit is not too big for traveling. The door that covers the slot, however, is very flimsy and easily deattaches (but fortunately easily reattaches too?) I use Mac OS X 10.4.8 and it works just fine. I also used it with Windows XP without any installation or transfer issues\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nA simple, cheap investment.  This CF reader actually does what it should, i.e. transfer info from compact flash to the computer.

The Tamrac bag is a nice bag and can be worn as either a shoulder bag or a waist bag. Unfotunately, it lacked sufficient support when worn as waist bag and did not have an attached pouch to carry a water bottle.  The Slinger Bag addressed both of these deficiencies.  When worn as a waist bag, it also uses the shoulder strap to keep the bag firmly in place which also helps to balance the weight of the bag.  There are two water pouches on the Slinger Bag (which is a real requirement as I live in Arizona).\\n\\nThe Adorama Slinger Bag is a great travel bag. It is light weight and has great utility.  I highly recommend it.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis was the least expensive 1 GB memory card I have ever seen and it works as well as it should\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have been trying to find a way to easily carry a lot of camera equipment for quite some time. I have tried backpacks, shoulder bags, duffel bags, but none of them really worked all that well. Then I saw the Lowepro Street and Field system with completely customizable pouches, vests, belts, and accessories. It works great, you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used (put frequently used items in easier to access places.) \\n\\nThe variety alone of this system is worth the investment, but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus. You can get a case for any lens, camera body, or accessory you have. I even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle. One word of caution, be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch, because sometimes the lens will fit, but then the lens with the lens hood will not. I often carry 5-6 lenses, extension tubes, teleconverters, extra memory cards and batteries, and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets, which weights a ton. But when they are evenly distributed on this vest/belt Lowepro system it is actually very manageable. \\n\\nThe only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body. But if you can overlook that, this is the way to go. I have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems, in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses. Many of the cases also come with a built in rain/snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed. You can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or don\\'t need to take all of your equipment, which is nice. I really can\\'t say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment, if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution, consider this, you won\\'t regret it.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nGreat for if you are not near a computer and need to charge your Ipo\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Memorex DVD+R 16x discs are great.

Generally my toddler boys are not permitted to handle discs, but it occassionally happens, and doesn\\'t take long for scratches, damage and finger prints to hinder performance, and when changing children\\'s cds in the car I don\\'t always store the disc properly and that leads to damage also.  I read through a lot of reviews on this item and the skipdoctor products, and finally decided on this unit because it runs on a/c power, is fully contained and automatic, and was about $10 less expensive than the most equivalent skipdoctor unit.  Both items had mixed reviews - mostly positive, but I found that most people who tried to make the units work and put in some time and effort were satisfied with both products.  I\\'m very satisfied with my purchase it has repaired two discs that could not be played at all, and one that skipped.  \\n\\nThis product repairs a disc to \"useable\" condition, it does not repair it so that scratches are not visible.  I can still see, but not necessarily feel the scratches.  It\\'s also important to remember that some scratches do not affect performance.  If a disc plays well, but shows scratches - I just clean off the finger prints with a cloth or use the unit to clean the disc and see if the performance is satisfactory before attempting a full repair.  \\n\\nI agree that the instructions with the unit could be better. I saved the instructions provided by another reviewer to use with the provided instructions for clarity. Also, some severely scratched and damaged discs do take many passes to repair, so I agree it is time consuming to acheive a full repair for some items - but it is possible.  I noticed that I could cut down some of the repair time and solution usage by repeating the buffing/sanding (pink disc) process several times in a row for deeper scratches before using the repair.  I ran one disc through 3 times in a row, then used the repair cream solution with yellow pads and it played fine.  My lesser damaged disc only required one pass with the buffer and one with the repair until it worked great.  I usually clean the disc (manually with the cloth or with the machine depending on severity of grime), then buff, then repair.  It can be time consuming to repair a disc to functioning, but it does save the disc and my discs play like new despite the scratches that are still visable.  I think this was good purchase and not overly complicated to use. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nSo far I havent filled up my disc yet using it.  The\\ndisc that came with it would fill up after 3 minutes of \\ntalking.  So far its great\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve read other reviews for this product that have people complaining about losing their data when the batteries are changed. THIS IS NOT TRUE if you\\'re carefull.  First of all, my ebookman came with a bright blue warning flier stating that your ebookman needs to be turned OFF when you change the batteries.  Pretty simple, huh?  Also, don\\'t wait for your battery to completely die before you change it. The main menu screen has a battery meter in the bottom right hand corner, and I just switch out the batteries when the meter reaches 10%.  I primarily use my ebookman to read ebooks and I love it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve been using these Memorex CD-Rs for years and have no problems with their reliability.

The cordless phone can be used to check the answering machine messages.  Lot\\'s of features\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe unit itself works great.  Much faster transfers than using the usb cable directly to my camera.  However, the software includes a \"monitoring\" feature, which checks every second or so, to see if you\\'ve plugged in a card.  I opened up Windows Task Manager to discover that, each time it checked, it was consuming 25% of system resources (on/off each second).  No wonder my computer has been slower lately, especially if I have my image editing software open (duh).\\n\\nMy recommendation would be to skip the San Disk software and access the card reader directly from My Computer, as mentioned in another review below\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nGreat quality, excellent construction and strong RJ45 plugs.

It is priced low, but functions like you paid a higher price.  The negatives are that it isn\\'t compatible with Itunes, and the earphones are not very ergonomically designed.  Overall, it is a good product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ll try to keep this short and sweet.  If you have been frustrated trying to get AM reception on the go, then you\\'ve found the right radio for you.  I can\\'t tell you how many pieces of junk I\\'ve bought that barely pulled-in even relatively close AM stations unless I constantly twisted the radio to the perfect angle needed to get reception.   Luckily (?) those other radios also died pretty quickly. This Sangean product solves the AM reception problem and seems very durable. I also own their CCRadio and this pocket product lives up to its reputation.  I love the fact that it also gives you the option to broadcast through the built-in speaker, just like transistor radios of the 50\\'s and 60\\'s--a seemingly forgotten feature.  As for listening through the supplied earphones, forget it. Sangean should be ashamed to ship this product with the utter junk earphones that are supplied.  Never have I heard tinnier sound, even for AM listening.  Not not mention that the cord is annoyingly short.  I immediatey invested another $35 in decent pair of Koss earbuds and stored the supplied earphones in the neareast trash bin.  Now I happily and easily listen to AM and FM stations even over the roar of the lawnmower.   There might be alternatives for those of you who plan on listening to FM exclusivey, but if you spend even a little time on the AM dial, I really don\\'t think you have a choice but to pick up this radio\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nSound great. Nice bank for the buck.\\n\\nDid the I-plop follower think they would fit inside his ear? Maybe he is bitter with the DRM and I-Tune scam that Job\\'s is screwing people over with. He\\'s worse than Microsoft. I \"love\" followers\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis was my second DLO transpod. I had an older white one that I bought used. I figured I would \"upgrade\" to this one since my iPod and my car\\'s interior are black. overall the thing performed similarly to my previous one, but with a few little changes.\\n\\nFor one the output of this unit is much lower than its older counterparts. That normally doesn\\'t matter if you choose a good empty frequency, but as you start traveling you notice interference much more than you would expect. \\n\\nNext, I can\\'t turn it up any where near the volume I used to be able to on the older one without getting hissing and static. It seems that the decreased level on the output also increased the amount of electronic noise when using it.\\n\\nLast, the most annoying part of this whole product, is that it turns off the radio transmitter after a period of no use. I have paused my iPod to take a phone call only to have very loud (since the level is so low on it you have to make up for it with stereo volume) static and sometimes radio stations coming through. Very embarrassing. Or when you stop your car and then come back, as soon as the radio turns on you are met with the same very loud noise.\\n\\nSince my car doesn\\'t leave me many options for stereo replacement, this is the best product for my specific situation, though I may try and get that old one back from my friend...maybe an \"upgrade\" to a newer one will settle the deal\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nYou must have received CA-709 (without the cassette component) by mistake.

It was easy to install and performs comparably well with more expensive units.  I am satisfied with the product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe reviews sounded too good to be true.  The reviews are right on.  This system is perfect for home theater.  I have the latest Panasonic plasma.  This receiver is the perfect compliment.  Here is why...\\n\\nI could only start with at 2.1 set up - L/C/R and no sub woofer.  Great digital sound effects with a one button switch to stereo for easy comparison.\\n\\nTons of input/output connectors.  Unless you need HDMI, the available connectors are perfect.  The speaker connectors are screw down/banana plug type for easy, secure connection.  Lots of component video, S-VHS and RCA video inputs.  Lots of analog audio connections AND two digital coax and one optical.  I use the digital coax for my DVD/CD and for my cable box.  \\n\\nReally easy set up.  I could assign inputs to the various selections through the front of the receiver.  The manual is written in easy to understand language with lots of pictures.\\n\\nDid I mention the sound.  Frys offers Polk Audio R15 for an indecently low price.  With this receiver the sound is rich - great bass and treble without any tweaking of levels.  Adding a Cerwin Vega center channel brought out the digital sound effects and this has them all.\\n\\nBest of all, my fashion master wife pulled the receiver out of the box before I got home and pronounced it beautiful.  It was the only low profile receiver I could find that fit in the armoire we use as an enterntainment station.\\n\\nThe end result - I sat down and just watched Hellboy for the first time all over again in the middle of the installation.  All for less than the cost of me and the Missus going to the movies for a few weekends.  Get this receiver\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis item does exactly what it\\'s suppose to do. It also makes the signal stronger therefore you get better reception. Worth the money. Only drawback would be, there is a lot of cord hanging around\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Sony SS-MF650H are a low-cost solution to good directional sound for a very small room.\\n\\nThough I have not had the opportunity to test the ultra-high (up to 50kHz) frequency, the highs on these speakers sound very well, maybe only slightly boxy - note that the speakers are rather directional so the sound does not spread.\\n\\nThe sound is very flat. The lack of depth makes it feel as if the sound is coming from a flat wall or a small box rather than from a space, especially if you stand further away (over 5 ft.) from the speakers. It seems that the speakers have a much lower than published sensitivity level. However, don\\'t get discouraged because with most speakers/headphones it may be that the speakers need some time to burn in (loosen the diaphragm) to get a bit more \"sustain\" to their output rather than seem to have a very sharp cutoff.\\n\\nThe bass is very punchy, and not deep. I would definitely recommend a subwoofer for these speakers, as their highs are very good, and midranges are nice but maybe a bit flat. The subwoofer will party compensate for the problem, and you could even completely cut off the bottom frequency band and suffer little ill effect (use the LFE on your receiver for the sub-woofer... don\\'t worry, low frequency bass is not perceived by humans as directional so your surround or stereo won\\'t suffer). In other words, you will need a lot of tweaking and additions to make these sound nicer than their out-of-the box quality.\\n\\nIgnore the 50kHz rating for ultra-high-frequency sound as a positive feature, as no receiver you will buy at the budget for these speakers will be rated for that output. Most are rated for 20 Hz - 20kHz, at a reasonable RMS.\\n\\nYou get what you pay for... for the price tag on them, the SSMF650H are good. They perform reasonably well on highs and mids (but in no means studio reference sound), and are crisp and punchy on the bass. They do however seem to lack depth and have low sensitivity - especially so on the bass... the further you move away from them (and especially if you stand up above them), the sound quality suffers.\\n\\nI would recommend Wharfedale Diamond 8.4 speakers as a better choice if you\\'re willing to expand your budget a bit. Polk is also not a bad choice for cheap sound.\\n\\nI also demo-ed the ~$100 per pair CAT SDAT LEB-404 (I think I saw them on overstock for $80 with free shipping). They are a bit shady, but excellent for the price - seems that the 20 Hz bass rating on them is actually somewhat accurate. If you\\'re looking for deep and bass-heavy sound without a sub-woofer, and are willing to take a hit on mids and highs a bit this is your \"budget solution\" instead of the SS-MF650H. I was pleasantly surprised. They also have poor sensitivity though, so if you have a big room shop around for something better.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI listen to a wide range of music, from hard rock, techno/electronic, to classical, and I\\'ve found it difficult to locate reasonably priced speakers that can handle all of this -- at least until I ordered this set.  I was apprehensive about buying online (and also about the Sony brand for speakers), but I\\'m very happy with this purchase.  I\\'ve been very impressed with the sound both at the high and low ends - the highs are crisp and the bass is tight, not boomy.  The soundstage is expansive (of course, this depends a lot on your receiver as well) and imaging good.  I\\'d definitely recommend this speaker set\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis first time I use the HD product in my home video system and have the expected results.

It is actually a DVD-224M (see manual) though it says DVD-224 on the player.  Here is how to do it:\\n\\nIf you have the DVD-224M model (says DVD-224 on the box, DVD-224M on the manual...), the hack is: \\n\\nMake sure you have no DVD in the tray. \\nOn the remote control: \\n1) Press \"TITLE\" \\n2) Press \"1\" and then \"9\" \\nOn the TV a large box with a small number will appear. \\nThe number indicates for which DVD region the machine has been set, for example \"2\" for Germany or \"0\" for no region code. \\n3) Press the up arrow or down arrow to raise or lower the number. \\n4) Press \"ENTER\" \\nDone. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nworked very well as planed\\njust heavy to carr\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI would have given it a five star but sense it\\'s the only one I have ever used I had nothing to compare with. I have used it nine tines and it worked perfect every time. Sturdily made.  \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe idea is excellent, the execution is flawed.  What is not made clear at the time of purchase is that you will need a bridge or gaming adapter as well as a high speed internet connection at home.  The adapter should be built into the box. \\nAnother disappointing factor is that the quality of the video is almost unwatchable if the connection is not robust.  There should be a cache memory built in so that a clear, unchoppy video and sound come through.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nOne of the best gadget-products I\\'ve ever bought.

In fact, it has more volume, depth, and presence than three other portable speakers--each costing 50 to 75% more--to which I\\'ve compared it.  The only downside is that the item is no longer sold postage-free from Amazon, diminishing its \"bargain\" appeal somewhat.)\\n\\nThese modest-sized and priced speakers perform as advertised: the sound is more than adequate; they\\'re small enough that I can take The Stephen Colbert Report  with me on walks; when not in use, they fold up into a mini Porta-John.

Here are the aspects people always want to know about:\\n\\nBASS: these don\\'t pound your eardrums in, but the bass that is there is infinitely cleaner and snappier than some of those boomy headphones I\\'ve heard.  You can really follow the bass line with these, rather than just having your eyeballs fuzz out from vibration.\\n\\nMIDS/HIGHS: this is the reason to buy these headphones.  Not too bright, but very clear, warm, smooth, soothing, and musical.  The first time I listened to music on these I was able to pick out the click of the pick against the guitar string, something I\\'d never heard before on that song.  In fact, I blame these headphones on my new addiction to, well, headphones.\\n\\nThese obviously can\\'t play as loudly as $200 headphones, and lack a little of the very lowest and very highest reach, but everything in the middle is VERY good.  I don\\'t think you can find headphones that are this nice to listen to for under $100.  And being under $20, you can buy a pair to try without feeling like you might be wasting a lot of money.  I should go work for these guys or something =)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was wondering if anyone knew if this hub would work for linking Xbox\\'s together so you can have more than 4 people play at once.

Then you drive around wondering if your $700 Nuvi is going to fall and break.  Not Fun!  The friction mount works for me. For everyday driving, even aggresive driving, it stays put.  Someone on this site left feedback about using it with their Nuvi 360 and I used their review to make the purchase.  I\\'m glad I did. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI think this is as good as the expensive over $60 HDMI cables.  I wouldn\\'t spend money on the expensive ones.  First of all, I\\'m not a cable junkie nor an expert.  However, according to my research, there\\'s no difference in performance b/w the expensive version nor the $12, $15, $20 version when it comes to HDMI since it\\'s all digital.. hole buch of zeros and ones.  The durability of the cables... I don\\'t know.  But unless you\\'re someone who constantly plugs and unplugs the cables for some reason, it wouldn\\'t matter.  Normally, you\\'d connect the cable and keep it that way for a long period of time, so the durability is not really relevant.  Bottomline: This is as good as the expensive ones.  I first tried out the expensive Monster brand which was $85.  Then I returned it after purchasing this, for the quality was the same.  Don\\'t buy the expensive ones\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is wonderful for laptop users that travel or like to move your laptop around a lot.

(disclaimer: I am not an audio professional, nor do I have any expensive headphones to compare with.)\\n\\nThey have great detail in both low and high end. In fact, I can hear things in some of my music that I never noticed before in either my small speakers or in the several foam on-ear style or earbud styles.  This is good when listening to original CDs, or HQ mp3/AAC, but it did reveal  some audio glitches and artifacts in lower quality mp3 that I had just not heard before...\\n\\nI tested these with a frequency response program on my Mac, show as having 25-15,600 Hz (in my ears, your ears may vary...) .  This range is better than most of my other inexpensive headphones and earbuds.\\n\\nThey do a good job of blocking out external noises-- great if you are in a bit of a noisy space.\\n\\nAnd, yes, they were a bit tight on the head initially.  To fix that, I got a stack of cd/dvd cases that was a bit wider than my head and allowed these headphones to be expanded by them for several overnight stretches (pun intended). This has helped too lessen the pressure they put on my ears and head to the point that they are now OK to wear for long periods.  NOTE: this procedure is at your own risk, as I do not think it is officially endorsed by the mfg.  ;-)   Do not overstretch them, as the headband material, while flexible, undoubtedly has limits to the stretch it can take.\\n\\nGreat Bargain Headphones\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNot an audiophile, but someone looking to spend a decent amount of money on a quality set of headphones.

The size of this USB drive and the fact that you\\'ll never have to worry about losing the cap along with an excellent price make it worth buying. After you uninstall the U3 software, it works like any other drive.

Brilliant...\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought these headphones a week ago and I am very pleased with them. At the electronic store, I listen to 3 pairs of Sennheiser (HD-433 ; HD-437 and HD-457). I hesitated between the 437 and the 457 but went for the 457 (10 more buck$). At the store the sound was OK as they were playing from the Sennheiser display rack. When I got home, I plugged these in my computer soundcard jack and the sound was a whole lot better. I am very impressed of the volume and sound quality I can get from them on my computer. My soundcard is an onboard Soundmax AC97 on an Asus K8V-X motherboard. I set the sound option in Windows XP on \"headphones\" and played \"Metallica- Nothing else matters\" with WinAmp. WOW !!! I was really impressed with the bass response and sound clarity in general. I only use half of the volume available in Windows XP and it`s more than enough for me.\\nI do agree with some other reviews that the bass could be more precise but I found out that it varies a lot depending of the sound source you`re using. The sound is better on  my computer than on my Harman Kardon amplifier and is a lot better on my MP3 player than with the earbuds that came with it.\\nOverall, I would say that these headphones are very good for the inexpensive price. They blow away all the competition in the same price range. Compared to my old Panasonic, it`s a drastic improvement especially for the bass response.\\nWhen it comes to music, I love bass a lot but I would recommand to others that you would listen to them from a source that you could adjust the bass level (bass knob or equalizer), so that way you won`t get too much bass from them.\\nVery good headphones ... Go get a pair ... at this price you can`t go wrong. I highly recommand them for computer users (music, DVD movies and games)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is one of the best wireless phones I\\'ve had -- good call quality, good speakerphone quality and good range\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nPanasonic makes good quality products and this is no exception.

The quality and finish of the materials is high. I am now a loyal Panasonic phone buyer\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt\\'s hard to believe the quality of the sound from this very small device.  MP3\\'s sound great as do the voice recordings.  With 1 gig of space you can record an entire day of seminar speakers and still have space left.  The built in STEREO OR MONO mics are great...PLUS, YOU CAN USE IT TO CARRY FILES TO AND FROM WORK.\\n\\nThe function buttons are logical and easily accessed, even with my big fingers.  Priced right, I\\'m glad I purchased.  Received it on time.  Totally happy with my purchase.  \\n\\nMy only wish is that it came with a case and a neck or wrist strap.  It\\'s so small it gets tossed into whatever pocket is available and that can lead to scratches from keys, etc\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am a success coach and I record all my coaching calls as a standard practice. This recorder has performed fantastically in all situations. I get about 9 - 12 continuous hours of battery operation (depending on battery quality) and the unit captures voices flawlessly during my calls (I have an adapter for the phone). I have used this in a seminar setting and have had great results. I highly recommend using rechargeable batteries (always have one extra on hand) when you are going to use the unit for extended periods of time. Recharge before your event each day and you won\\'t miss a thing. The unit only uses one battery and it\\'s always a great idea to have a spare. The unit does not audibly warn when the battery is about to expire, so keeping a fresh charge should provide you with uninterrupted recordings. Each stop and restart begins a new file. For me that works great! If you are looking for one continuous file, do not shut it off. You can also buy software that will let you merge the files for your later use. You would be hard pressed to find a better product for the money\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nA good stuff at great price and as usual Amazon was fast to send the item\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI decided to replace my iRiver 190T after a 3rd party cable adapter malfunctioned and fused the pin connection to the USB cable together.  I wanted USB 2.0 for the faster connection and a larger capacity, but still desired standard user replaceable batteries on a flash based player so I picked this up on sale.\\n\\nI may still search for a used iRiver 190T after playing with the Lyra RD2315.

This Apple 20\" is very close in spec to my iMac 20\" screen. Stores like Best Buy do not have good quality 20+\" LCDs in yet. You want the 16x9 profile also, the regular square LCDs look dorky in comparison and typically have lower brightness and contrast ratios. The newer stuff is very bright and clear. It is obvious when you go to a store and look at the LCD screens. The cheap $200 LCDs just don\\'t look good in comparison to the new stuff.\\n\\nIntel iMac screen:\\n1680x1050\\n280 cd/m2 (brightness in candle power)\\n800:1 Contrast ratio\\n\\nApple 20\" LCD\\n1680x1050\\n250 cd/m2  \\n400:1 Contrast\\n14ms response time (www.apple.com/displays/specs.html)\\n\\nOther comparables:\\nGateway 21\" 1680x1050 $599\\n300 cd/m2  1000:1 contrast\\n\\nDell 24\" 2405FPW $800\\n1920 x 1200\\n500 cd/m2\\n1000:1 contrast\\n\\nYou should be aiming for at least 300 cd/m2 on brightness and close to 1000:1 contrast.  These Apple LCDs have been out for awhile and are starting to show their age in comparison to the brand new products that have just started to come out. If you are using your LCD for a TV you may need the brightness, but for computer work the Mac 20\" LCD is just about right. \\n\\nI paid a few $$$ more ($750 total price) for the Apple LCD, but I feel I made the correct purchase. I just didn\\'t like the way the others looked and it had to look good against my iMac. I actually like this screen better than the one on my iMac and it seems just as bright even if the specs say that it is not. Amazon also boxes the shipment (besides the Apple box) so your screen should arrive undamaged\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve been slowly making my way to the Mac side after nearly 15 years of unadulterated Windows/DOS use.  The process has been slow mainly because of the price and availability of Apple products:  High and Scarce.\\n\\nThe best thing about Apple is that their customer forums are full of people like you and me, and if you have a problem, someone else has most likely had it, too.  Those forums helped in my decision to purchase this monitor.\\n\\nI had been looking closely at the 23\" monitor.  When I read about a majority of the displays getting a pink tint after only a few hours of use, I realized I would either wait until Apple re-engineered the monitor, or look at other options.\\n\\nWith the 20\" Aluminum, I didn\\'t have to look far.  I wanted a monitor that would compliment my G4 laptop (Powerbook), but I didn\\'t want to break the bank, either.  The answer was turning to ebay.  $600 out the door.  Mint condition.  Saved over $150, and the monitor works and looks great!\\n\\nThe 20\" and 30\" models have had no problems.  If you can buy them new, go for it.  If you can buy new, but would rather spend that extra money on something else, check out the ebay auctions\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was looking for a basic cordless phone with out an answering machine and this one is great.

Like the other reviewers, I found it easy to setup: tune the radio, turn on iPod, connect the Pico, tune the Pico, done).  In my car, the static interference was less noticeable when the unit was placed in close proximity to the radio.  I noticed this as well with my home stereo. Maybe the next generation Pico needs a larger antennae, or my iPod needed charging.  Regarding sound quality, my other car has a built-in iPod connector.  The Pico sound quality is comparable, somewhat muted, but enjoyable.  The Pico does offer the advantage of displaying the iPod menu to select tunes.  I\\'ve read mixed reviews on other FM transmitters, but I am pleased with the Pico\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI ordered this device to sit on a player piano, which can play ipod encoded MP3 files, once they are transferred from the special CDs that are designed for the piano.  The remote is limited, as are all remotes for ipods, but for the special use I have, this is a great product.  It allows me to sit across the room and pause the piano or select the next piece of music\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was looking for an inexpensive, yet high quality, long lasting, and durable way to identify dozens upon dozens of electrical wires behind the instrument panel of my airplane. A fellow pilot made me aware of the family of small electronic labelers available in the marketplace. The Brother 1750 fits my needs perfectly. Offering two lines of crisp, highly readable print gives a professional appearance to all labeling needs. My experience is quite different than some reviewers who have complained about wasted tape. In fact, I found that little wasted tape is generated if you simply adjust the margins to a particular task and this option is clearly spelled out in the instruction booklet. Since I purchased the 1750, I have found many uses for it around the home office and I wonder how I got by without one in the past! My only complaint about the keyboard is that among the characters, it does not offer a dash or hyphen, so when one is  required, I find myself using a star instead. That is a minor complaint though.  The Brother 1750 gets considerable mileage on AA battery power alone, so I have not felt the need to purchase the adapter\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe recently purchased 4 of these phones and all of them work fine. The CID works perfectly for both lines. The interface/menu takes a few minutes to learn and get used to but I wouldn\\'t call it \"non-intuitive\".\\n\\nThe Redial button (as you can see in the picture) is right above the number pad. If you can\\'t find it, you might want to buy a phone with less buttons and less features. And it\\'s pretty simple to redial a number in the CID display... when you see/get to the number press Enter twice (Once to bring up the \"MENU\", and Once more to \"DIAL\"). In fact you can also save that number into the phone\\'s memory through the menu (press Enter once and scroll through the options)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAt first, I was not sure about if this Windshield Mounting Bracket was going to stay in place while I drive trough the streets. However, I was very surprised when I found out that the Bracket stayed put all day going from one place to another, even under some vibration. The suction rubber system is quite strong. It has 2 angles for adjustment, and you can rotate the GPS clockwise/counterclockwise.\\n\\nPros: Strong suction rubber system, GPS mounting system\\nCons: Lack of a 4th angle for adjustment (the GPS can only be adjusted in the windshield plane, so you can not turn it towards your face for easy viewing - that\\'s why I give 4 stars\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVery strong suction cup provides secure mounting.

Makes a difference if you\\'re short on space\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was paranoid about having buyer\\'s remorse from this unit. For such a cheap price I was sure I would end up regretting the purchase. What is the tradeoff? Shoot if know, but I haven\\'t regretted buying it one bit. The receiver is perfect for home theater, particularly DD 5.1 shows. There is absolutely no discernable speaker hiss with digital content, which is important for TV watching that has a high range of both loud and silent moments.\\n\\nAs for power, it\\'s not an even match with some of the more power hungry and expensive analog amplifiers out there, but it easily crosses the threshold of annoying the neighbors.\\n\\nDigital is something to get used to. On conventional receivers, you turn the sound up high and it becomes somewhat sloppy, or what some call \"warm\". Not so with the digital Panny. It\\'s distortion free up to very high levels. I wouldn\\'t call it bright, but the response is very linear and precise. I like hearing all the details in music and cinema, even at loud volume. Others don\\'t.\\n\\nThe weaknesses are very minor:\\n\\n-The FM tuner is nothing special.\\n-It lacks fancy DSP modes of expensive receivers.\\n-No fancy on screen display (must do most of the tweaking with knobs)\\n-It does not upconvert video.\\n-The remote control is an el cheapo.\\n\\nFor this price, though, who cares\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this receiver from Fry\\'s Electronics in San Diego, CA for $199.99. At first, I was a little hesitant about purchasing an all digital receiver. When I got it home, and connected it, I was amazed. This receiver will blow you away with the precision of it\\'s home theater capabilities. I am using four Polk R30\\'s as my fronts, and rear surround, and two Sony center channels for my front center, and rear center channels. I also have a KLH 10inch Tremor Series powered subwoofer. I estimate the entire system to cost about $650.00 total. I have colleague that has a Bose home theater system, and my little system blows his out of the water, and he paid much more for the Bose. If you want a great receiver a minimal price, this is the way to go. By the way, did I mention that it has four digital inputs, an optical output, and HDMI in and out connections.

Neither came close to the quality of this transmitter. Neither charged the iPod (The Belkin required batteries, which only lasted about 15 hours of use), while the iTrip worked OK at first, but then started getting static no matter what station I used. In fact, I had to have the iPod in hand for the static to go away (and then, it was still not clear). The sound isn\\'t as loud as some (it takes over the volume control, so you cant use the volume on the iPod.) Still, it\\'s not nearly as soft as some I\\'ve seen. I found most music came through at a good volume (I did adjust a few songs in iTunes to pump them up). This unit, although it seems cheap and flimsy at first, is able to get a consistant, strong signal, even on stations which usually come in clearly. It powers through them, and the result is a very clean sound. It is a little hard to read at the regular angle, but once you set the 3 presets, you don\\'t need to see the screen. Just set your radio to the same 1-2-3 configuration. Also, turning it at a 90 degree angle lets you see the screen much clearer. In all, I couldn\\'t be happier\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nat such low price, this player is really pretty good.\\n\\nit gets the job done, even though the UI is a little bit basic.\\n\\nit can record in DVD+R and DVD-R, and has a 10 hour mode.

The reason behind that is because they\\'re truly excellent headphones. The range is spectacular and the inputs even more so. You\\'re given the option of RCA and Toslink (optical), which is all you really need. \\n\\nMovies really do sound like movies...you hear things behind, in front, and to your left and right when you\\'re connected via optical. Take note that DTS also sounds \\'boomier\\' and a tad crisper than Dolby D does, especially in Gladiator. \\n\\nHonestly, I\\'ve nothing to complain about. As a college guy, I couldn\\'t bring my 1010 watt system from home. Which, I might add, never sounded as good as my headphones, mostly because headphones will always have the advantage of being closer to you physically. Listening to music at extremely high bit rates and using the optical connection from my Macbook Pro truly does some incredible things. You\\'d be amazed at Coldplay\\'s \"The Scientist\" if you heard it on these headphones. It\\'s indescribable.\\n\\nAnd by the way, I\\'m a slight audiophile.\\n\\nYou seriously can\\'t go wrong with these headphones. And $65 for each additional pair of headphones, allowing you to add as many as you want to one base station? Even better...good idea for families in apartments.\\n\\nIncredibly advanced technology, incredible sound, and incredible results. Can\\'t go wrong here.\\n\\nOh, and they\\'re extremely comfy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI just recently purchased the Quickcam STX for my sister who lives overseas in Greece. It\\'s a great way for us to connect especially since we only see each other on an annual basis. Surprisingly, the video and audio is quite good. I do have a Mac and she doesn\\'t have any issue calling me from her pc.  We use Aol instant messenger (Video and Audio) or Yahoo Messenger (Video) to connect.  I still prefer the iSight for Macs.  Unfortunately, you can\\'t use an iSight on a pc. Wish Apple could make the iSight compatible with PC\\'s.

Just got these after usinf Shure E3s for about a year. I liked those but find these even better. When I first tried them I found the base so much stronger than the E3s as many have alluded to. Now I run my iPod at normal equalizer settings. I find the balance of the set dead on. The fit is great, of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is my second FM transmitter and works much better than the Belkin that I ended up returning because it simply wasn\\'t working.\\n\\nIt plugs firmly into my cigarette lighter and stays there, unlike the Belkin (I drive a 2001 BMW 325ci). It is easy to use with the preset FM stations. It works right out of the box, you\\'ll be ready to go within seconds. The sound is crisp, with some static interference, which can be expected in a big city. Unmounting my car\\'s antenna helps a little but doesn\\'t completely cure the interference. I have a factory BMW Business radio which picks up FM signals pretty much without an antenna.\\nThere is nothing to mount the iPod so you\\'ll either have to set it in your cup holder or purchase a case separately.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t spend more than $45 on any FM transmitter as there will always be minor interference in urban areas. I won\\'t be getting rid of my CD changer just yet\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had my Axim x51v for about three months.  I purchased it from Dell for $480 with aluminum hardcase, extra 1100mAh battery, and auto power cord.\\n\\nStrengths: Just about everything.  The processor is absolutely incredible.  I heard (unconfirmed) that the Intel 624 MHz PXA270 is faster than a 2GHz Pentium 3!  It sure seems like it.  This PDA blazes through movies, photos, games, word processing, and anything else I can throw at it.  \\nThe other definite high point for this PDA is the screen.  Once you see a VGA screen like this, you will be astounded at the difference it can make over a QVGA screen.  I have to get about 4 inches from the screen to even see the pixels.  The screen is crystal clear.  \\nThe battery life is phenomenal, even with the standard low capacity battery.  Playing a movie at full brightness and full volume will last about 2 hours, extended to about 4.5 hours on low brightness and headphones.  Turned off with a 1GB SD card drains the battery about 2% per day.  \\nWiFi is amazing.  It connects consistently and is moderately easy to set up.  Once connected, it keeps the signal well and is, while not fast, reasonable for speed\\nJust about everything on this PDA is almost perfect.\\n\\nWeaknesses: Not enough programs to start with, Windows Media Player 10 (Download TCPMP, it\\'s way better)\\n\\nProblems: Don\\'t use Odyssey Client, it makes the PDA start up really slow.  Also, in ActiveSync, On the PDA, select Menu, Add Server Source.  On all of the screens, put random characters in each field, and deselect any check boxes that tell it what to synchronize.  Then go to menu, schedule and select manual for both.  Then go to menu, options, and delete the entry that you just added (the one that has no boxes under it checked) and delete it.  It fixes a myriad of problems and makes the PDA run faster, and it still syncs automatically in the cradle.\\n\\nConclusion: An awesome PDA that does just about everything.  Combine it with a BT keyboard and perhaps even a BT mouse, and you have an unbeatable combination of power and portability.  Everything works extremely well\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis phone has noticably greater range and clarity than our other wireless phones.

I updated it with the new drivers and software on the Creative site (from January 2006) immediately and I have not had any of the problems others mention.  The image quality is excellent with good lighting and the camera is fast since it is a true USB 2.0 camera. It will work with USB 1, but be sure you use USB 2.0 for better quality.\\n\\nVideo calls run a bit choppy if there is a lot of movement, but for basic conversations, it is fine.  I use 8 Mbs cable and I connect with people using the same or high speed DSL.\\n\\nThis camera takes great video &amp; photos and has an excellent one click panoramic option that does all of the stitching for you.  If you want to take a large group shot, it is really cool.  The other features like security and remote monitoring are very useful as well.  I don\\'t use the face tracking.  \\n\\nThe base deserves a mention too.  I use this on my notebook and on my desktop.  It\\'s cool that the base works with both notebook screens and on flat surfaces.  Highly recommended for the price now with the current rebate Amazon is offering\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI wanted a combo and this seems to be the best one on the market now days.\\nThe mouse is very good, a tad small, but still very comfortable. Not as good as  Logitechï¿½ MX(tm)500 for my hand (I\\'d say I have a medium size hand), but still a very solid product. Side buttons are very useful. No need to install any additional drivers for XP if you are ok with the default behavior. Just plug it in and use.\\nThe keyboard is so-so. It is not bad, but just not very comfortable, especially compared to Microsoft keyboards. (I use Microsoft 4000 for work and it really shines). The labeling is very small, Insert/Delete keys are not standard and I hate Vista ready button, if you hit it in the middle of the game you are lucky not to crash.\\nWould I buy it again? Yes.

What I found is that this is caused by the tension of the headband frame pushing into the plastic.  In fact, the plastic broke from just sitting in my drawer for a week with the headband fully extended.\\n\\nMy recommendation is to store these headphones with the earcups fully retracted, to reduce the tension of the headband frame on that piece of plastic.  Bose replaced them with no hassles, no receipt, no registration, just sent them back and got a brand new pair.  I think that was well worth the money spent over 2 years ago\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently received the Zen Microphoto as a gift.  Since I travel fairly often, I decided to purchase the Traveldock after reading the reviews.  It\\'s great.  The Microphoto fits in easily and comes out just as simply.  The sound is rich, loud enough, and better than any other travel speakers that I own.  Many people comment on the bass issue.  For travel speakers, the Traveldock has the best bass to date, in my opinion.  True bass enthusiasts could purchase the subwoofer (for an additional $60 from Creative\\'s website).  I\\'m very satisfied with the sound and the convenience.  The jacks are easy to reach and use, which are on the back of the unit.  Also, the Microphoto charges while docked, whether it\\'s playing or not.  There\\'s even an attachable FM antenna that plugs in to give you reception when docked (since you are not using the earphones which serve as an antenna also).  By the way, it comes with a remote control which allows you to switch between FM and MP3\\'s, adjust volume, and play/pause/FF/Rew.  Overall, this is a very nice addition to the Zen Microphoto.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAgain, Creative Labs has combined all you need into one package: line in jack, usb port, fm antenna, and even a jack for a sub-woofer! for a small portable speaker, this system gets pretty loud and clear. The stereo effect button works great, the design is very stylish and the remote is a nice finishing touch. now for the cons;like most reviewers,i too, have to say the bass is lacking a bit, and the stand has a bit of trouble holding the speakers up due to small rubber feet that doesnt grip very well. and the last thing is the speakers itself doesnt have any grill or guard on it and it looks like it could be damaged easily, but these are minor things i can overlook and all in all for the price, this speaker system is very good.    \\ni tried the Altec Lansing portable speakers for the same price and i returned it the next day. it didnt even get half as loud without distortion and it didnt have as many cool features either.\\nright now, im using the speakers with the zen nano plus and it works great! im saving up for the zen micro now and if it sounds good with the nano, then i know the TravelDock will sound amazing with the micro that it was intended for.\\n one more thing, if your going to use the line-in cable for a device other than the zen micro, be sure to insert the BLACK end of the cable into the device your want to play and the WHITE end into the speakers line-in jack. i read a reviewer who said the speakers sounded tinny like a transistor radio and its because she had the wrong ends of the cable attached. i did it myself and i figured it out. unlike the reviewer who returned the speakers before taking the time to learn how to use it before returning it and giving it a bad review. \\nI love these speakers and i even use them for my t.v and they sound great for that too\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought these speakers based on price because I just wanted to get some budget speakers to start off with on my home theater.  It turns out that these speakers have amazing sound quality easily rivaling speakers that cost 10x the price.\\n\\nI really can\\'t find one bad thing to say.  Even at high volumes they have a crystal clear pristine sound.  The sub woofer pumps a nice rich heavy bass. Take advantage of the low price on these speakers, you won\\'t find a better deal.\\n\\nI\\'m using these speakers with a Harman Kardon AVR 240 receiver and I also have two Polk R15\\'s as my front left and right\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nnice little system but only 4 ohms so doesnt handle a lot of power.

I began printing my own pictures and have tried every brand of photo paper out there (Kodak, HP, store brands, etc. etc.).  By far, the most superior paper is Canon.  They make fabulous photo paper that is reasonably priced and prints GREAT photos.  \\n\\nI did a wedding album using Canon photo paper and the couple I gave it to thought that the photos were as good as the photographer they\\'d hired, which speaks volumes to the quality of Canon paper.\\n\\nI\\'d highly recommend that people use this brand.  You won\\'t be sorry\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nEchoing most other reviews here, this is an excellent set of earphones that are well worth the money.  But buying them is a risk! If you don\\'t wear these earphones correctly, they sound terrible, easily shown up by any pair of throwaway phones.  Those unsatisfied with the sound quality (especially those complaining of lack of bass) either haven\\'t put them in correctly or have oddly shaped ears.\\n\\nLearning how to put them in properly takes time.  Be prepared to spend a few hours fiddling with them and trying the different included cushions.  Once you teach yourself how to put them in, it will only take a few seconds.  Some tips: Before inserting the earbuds, draw the phones up from behind your ear, holding the earbuds in the correct orientation (drivers pointing medially), so the wires fall naturally between your head and pinna and the earbuds are just outside your ear canals. With one hand, pull the superoposterior part of the pinna in a superoposterior direction while inserting the earphone with the other.  This straightens the ear canal and makes it easier to insert the earphone.  (Your doctor uses the same maneuver when he/she examines you with an otoscope.) You may also wish to twist the earphone during insertion so that it lodges itself better.  If the phones are properly inserted, they will have sealed your ear canals and you may want to relieve pressure via your Eustachian tubes (that is, swallow), just as on a climbing plane or skyscraper elevator.\\n\\nIt may seem like it takes a lot of work (and possibly learning a bit about anatomy) to get these earphones to work as intended.  It does, and success is not guaranteed.  But it\\'s worth it! And to save your hearing, don\\'t forget to turn down the volume, since your music will no longer have to compete with outside noise\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis was the largest set that would fit into my space. I also looked at the Westinghouse 37 inch HD moniter at Best Buy. The first time, I looked at the Westinghouse the picture looked a bit fuzzy. Then I read the review on CNET which said the Westinghouse picture was actually better than the Sharp. I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale. On HD, the picture is amazing. It\\'s also quite good on regular TV. \\nMy only regret is that Toshiba has just come out with a 37inch LCD with a DVD built in. If I  had known, I would have waited to check out that model\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe bought 3 of these and every one has dead pixels.

Not only look cool, but sound great. Have only had for two months, but no issues.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBefore i bought this product, i was contemplating which brand name hard drive i should go with.  I was told Seagate was top of the line.  It truly is.  No problems at all, easy to setup and use, and a fair price.  I highly recommend Seagate over any other brand name (I\\'ve heard problems with other brands)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a great little piece of hardware. \\n\\nI bought it for my MP3\\'s and movies, and I\\'m very pleased. It\\'s totally \"plug-n-play\"; there aren\\'t even any drivers that need updating, assuming you have XP up to par. \\n\\nIt gives 160GB (well, 149 in actuality) of space to work with. After moving nearly 50 gigs over to it at once, on the first day, it froze up. After that minor incident, I\\'ve had no problems, though, and my machine runs alot faster because of it. With my 100G of music already on it, I\\'m very happy with it. It has given me no fuss--it doesn\\'t even give me any noise! It\\'s as silent as a fart, and that\\'s a big plus.\\n\\nI found mine at Wal-Mart for $114 and I think that I made a good purchase. If you\\'re on a budget, this is about as good as it gets. Seagate\\'s 300GB is also highly recommended, as I\\'ve worked with it before. A+\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis drive is whisper quiet, easy to install and use, and in my experience, plenty fast. I recently encoded my CD collection in flac format and am using this drive to store files. I also used foobar2000/LAME to convert the flac files to MP3, all on this drive. During the process of converting the files, which is pretty IO-intensive, I found the drive to be completely reliable and the speed to be more than adequate\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this radio to keep on my kitchen counter.  I chose Boston Acoustics over Tivoli because you can\\'t preset the stations in the Tivoli and I like to flip through commercials. Other reviewers wrote that the bass can be overpowering.  I listen to rock music and do not notice the bass. My complaint is that this radio advertises itself as picking up weak stations very clearly.  It does not pick up stations much better then the other radios in my house.  Also if you are listening to the radio you can\\'t see the time display.\\n\\nThis radio is great if you have limited space.  It looks good and sounds like a much larger radio. It has a lot of power for a small radio.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nExcellent accessory, portable and you do not have to apply anything permanent to your vehicle....highly recommended\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWow! Now I can transfer all I have in my PC to my cellphone. It\\'s awesome... I need no cable to transfer stuff from my PC to my cellphone and from my cellphne to my PC. You can get this item in a very special price. Get it!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI own a set of older Martin Logan speakers. Their quality is legendary with a price to match. So I was interested in maximizing performance. When I called their office for advice, one of the tech guys (excellent service, by the way) told me the Monster banana plugs were great, not the best or most expensive available, but a good value. That was enough for me. My speakers are bi-wired so I purchased two sets of four plugs. Installation was a snap and the sound is wonderful. Add to that the free shipping, no tax and a total price saving of $12.00 and you can\\'t do better than Amazon!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis ain\\'t cheap, but it\\'s worth it. I\\'ve learned my lesson buying cheaper toner cartridges, but they don\\'t even come close to the quality and longevity of the Brother brand. You get what you pay for..\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNo problems with these, and great price at amazon\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is an awesome little MP3 player.  I enjoy both the MP3 player and the FM radio.  It is very easy to use and syncs well with Windows Media Player.  It is perfect for going to the gym because it is so small.  It came with a great leather case that fits it well and prevents damage and scratches.  My only problem with the player is that I can\\'t fit more than 66-69 songs although it says there is about 70MB of space left on the player\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve been using this router for a few days. I just had to set it up - I haven\\'t had any cause to touch it since, it\\'s very reliable. Highly recommended\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nUnit works about as expected, with possible exception of a few areas of the screen that are not too sensitive to the touches from the stylus.  So far I am working around that.  This is my 3rd Deluxe and the 1st one to give any operational problem of any sort.  Generally a good product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nYeah, so apparently this was a really good PDA to buy. I BOUGHT THIS THREE YEARS AGO AND IT STILL WORKS! Ive been searching for a new PDA since I thought this one was so out of date, and when reading all the reviews I came across many new \"state of the art\" PDAs that broke after only a few months. This baby has been great to me for three long years, so if you are looking for a reliable buy, go for this. Definately NOT flashy, very basic. All I use it for is appointments, dates, and to-dos. GREAT FOR STUDENTS WHO WANT TO USE A PDA AS AN AGENDA! \\n\\nGood luck on your PDA search!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am working with my new PDA the Live Drive and is great to have akk ny videos, music and to write my notes and documents before my shift or meeting, and also the wireless connection is so great.

If you\\'re not a techie, I\\'d stay away until Microsoft has certified the WPN311. Here\\'s what I experienced:\\n\\n1. Installed using the Netgear WPN311 automated configuration.\\n2. After installation completion and boot up, CPU utilization was at a solid 100%.  Executable from Netgear named WLANCFG5.EXE taking up a bunch of the CPU and Microsoft routines CSRSS.EXE, NET.EXE, and NET1.EXE taking the rest.\\n3. Emailed Netgear and received response to use Task Manager to delete WLANCFG5.EXE.  Did so for all users.\\n4. Hey!  CPU utilization returned to normal!\\n5. Sent next email to Netgear pointing out that this solution is just a \"patch\" and WLANCFG5 would return when I re-booted.\\n6. Received response to de-install and re-install software for WPN311.\\n7. Did so, but then Netgear adapter software could not find my MIMO wireless router!  And usage of the Netgear adapter software doesn\\'t allow you to use the Microsoft Wireless Zero Configurator (WZC).\\n8. Went to microsoft.com and looked up error 871122 \"Error message when you try to run the Wireless Network Setup Wizard\" and followed the instruction to allow usage of WZC.\\n9. Then able to add my wireless router and everything is ok.\\n\\nThe functionality works great.  It\\'s the getting there that\\'s not too pretty good.....\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI lost my previous RadioShack surge strip and the various pieces of equipment attached to it in the Queens power failure and wanted something dependable. The price is great for its rating and all the stuff included, and it is kind of cool-looking too!  Recommend without reservation\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m using the Monster Cable MP Home Theater PowerCenter HTS800 to remove line noise in the electrical current to a high-end tube pre-amp.  The line noise is removed beautifully; however, the PowerCenter itself creates a high-pitched tone.  The tone comes out of the PowerCenter device directly.  If you are planning to use this product on a high-end sound system, I recommend placing it in a location that is acoustically isolated. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor the background, I\\'ve owned &amp; used various IEM (In-Ear-Monitor) headphones over the years: Ety ER4p, Altec Lansing iM716, Shure E2c, Sony EX71, Koss KSC75.  Here\\'s my quick impression after using these headphones for a week:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Very good bass &amp; well balance (not as bloated as the Sony EX71, the ER4p has tight but the least bass-feel/effect.)  Mid-range is good. Treble is just a little bit harsh right out of the box (but can be tamed with EQ.)\\n2. Easy to drive (with the iM716 phones, I\\'d need to crank up the vol.)\\n3. Very light weight\\n4. Comfortable tips (3 sizes included)\\n5. Decent isolation from outside noise (the ER4p &amp;iM716 have better isolation)\\n6. Moderately priced ($50)\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Cables are thin so handle with care.\\n2. Some people may not like the \"phonendoscope effect\" (cables frictions.)  This is very common with IEM headphones, some are more than others.\\n3. No pouch or case\\n\\nPS: For bass-heads, you will like these IEMs - from an owner of Beyer DT770-80\\'s experience :\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAll in-ear headphones will make some noise when the wires brush up against something.  Sound travels along wires... it\\'s physics, there\\'s nothing you can do about that.  Now, these earphones are incredibly light-weight and the wires are thin so that actually reduces the noise traveling through the wires.  \\n\\nThese headphones are called \"asymmetric,\" meaning that the right earbud is on a longer wire than the left.  You wear this by putting the wire on the right earbud BEHIND your neck.  This leaves the area in front of you clear of wires that could get tangled up in your hands.  This also makes it easy to each lunch while listening to music so your food doesn\\'t spill on the wire.\\n\\nI paid about 60 bucks and for that price, I love these headphones.  Face it, these are low to mid-range in terms of price, but perform more like mid-range to high range if you ask me.  The cable is thin and flexible yet seems pretty resistant to damage.  The buds are comfy and I like the asymmetric design.  People need to realize that there are premium headphones for $500 or more.  I think people need to keep perspective and not have TOO high expectations from only a $60 pair\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the 4th spindle I\\'ve ordered and I haven\\'t had a problem with any of my DVDs. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis little charger works great. It is the second one of it\\'s kind that I have purchased. The last one took a lot of abuse and therefore I needed to replace it. Would buy it again.

The keyz are in the perfect spot to kill all your fellow gamers. all you need is the fang and a mouse and your good to go. you have to get this if you want to stand a chance in FPS games.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI love the new nanos. I don\\'t think I have anything bad to say about it besides it not having a radio. It is small and very thin. You barely feel it in your pocket, which might annoy some people but not me. I\\'d rather get this than any Zen products or Sandisk Sansas because it looks way better and it way thinner. The screen is really bright with the full color display. The new earbuds are A LOT more comfortable than the old ones. The new ones aren\\'t as bulky and actually fit in my small ears with out them slipping out. I don\\'t know why people hate the sound of the earbuds but they are certainly loud and good enough for me! The new color coating is scratch resistant, but not the click wheel and the Apple symbol. But you don\\'t notice the scratches on the white parts. The longer battery life is twice as long as the first generation nano, 24 hours! The new 4 GB color nanos are the same price as the 2 GB of the 2nd gen nanos. I\\'m so happy I waited after the 1st gen nanos came out. I would never get the 1st gen nanos now since they scratch easily, have a dark screen, and have a short battery life. The new nanos are great deals and great gifts. I recommend this mp3 player to anyone that wants a good, reliable, scratch resistant, cool looking music player! 5/5 star\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am satisfied.

This seems a little slow, but it doesn\\'t bother me much.  The Passport is small, has a nice rubber coating to prevent shock, and overall is worth the purchase price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese Verbatim discs have the DataLife Plus layer of protection that will allow them to last 100+ years. I\\'m a professional photographer and it\\'s crucial to store my client\\'s digital photos and artwork onto a disc that will remain stable in years to come. I\\'ve tried many brands and types of discs and have lost data (read errors) many times but so far with the hundreds of Verbatim discs I\\'ve burned so far, I haven\\'t had a problem yet. The Kodak brand discs were also excellent, but Kodak discontinued making them. SONY also makes a good disc. These discs can be printed on directly with an ink jet printer such as the Epson R200/R300/R320, and the surface area is printable right up to the hub! I have no reason to switch to any other brand as long as Verbatim continues to make a great disc\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese Verbatims are terrific.  As you may know, working with DVD-R media is almost a gamble...cheap media will save you a few pennies but either give you coasters or media that plays on few players.  Sticking to name brands helps, but even then, some brands rely on outside sources for their media and while one lot/batch may be good, the next batch from the same brand may be from somewhere else.  Usually, you\\'re safe with media made in Japan.  These Verbatim\\'s are made in Taiwan but, they are great..I\\'ve bought one every couple months and I\\'m on my 3rd spindle now.\\n\\nThey have a wonderful printing surface that as mentioned, dries nearly instantly in Epson printers (I use an R200).  Hub printable so you can print all the way to the edge which gives your discs a terrific look when printing nice disc art or photos.  Not one coaster so far, burned with Apple Powerbook 2X Superdrive as well as a Lacie D2 Firewire writer. Though the media is 8X, it works in my Panasonic DVD Recorder (DMR-E55) which recommends up to 4X media perfectly).  So far, I have not encountered one person who has not been able to play the discs (Samsung, Sanyo, Panasonic, Sony, Apex, Toshiba DVD Players, PS2, XBox, no problems) .  Over 134 discs so far, and they look great, play great, and are a great price for hub printable discs.   Highly recommended...I\\'m ordering more!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNotebooks Pro is the highest rated webcam (for notebooks) on the market and for good reason.  Audio and Video quality is excellent.  You can talk normal and be 2 or 3 feet away with no problem.  The echo cancellation feature is a true must for webcams, especially with the use of video.  On the negative side the USB cable is too short which limits interchangeability with your desktop.  Also, I have the Quickcam Fusion for my desktop which is a 5 star rated product and without doubt the best of the best webcams overall.  Logitech ships that product with Quickcam 10 software which is probably a nice update to Quickcam 9 the Notebook Pro uses.  Unfortunately, Logitech provides little detail and info on these technical and software issues.  B\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had the previous version also. It is so far the best webcam I ever owned. Don\\'t even bother to compare it with cheap creative ones. The frame rate and picture quality is awesome. Works in very low light conditions and has great software which can even make gieco or alien out of you. \\n\\nThey keep on working for years. My old one \"Quickcam for notebooks Pro\" still a champion after use of 3 years now. I got bored and gave it to my uncle. And boy he loves it too. Newer one as mentioned by other reviewers holds much better.\\n\\nDo I sound Like a logitech sales person? Well I must admit that I am very happy with their webcams.

My Parents back in other part of world can see even tiny things in my room which they shouldn\\'t :).\\n\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this mouse because I have developed carpel tunnel pain in my shoulder from years and years of mouse activity. I\\'m happy to say it is nearly gone (the pain) - I ordered one for my office and will now get one for home.  It does take a bit of getting used to (after years of movable mouse action) - but it can be done.\\n\\nGood luck\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nUnlike many other cables that splice A/V output, this cable does so while retaining the details of that output.  I.e., both Left and Right channels are extracted and outputted, not simply the Left channel with audio mixed down to mono.  Also, it works on some computers, too!\\n\\nOn the minus side, I haven\\'t gotten it to work on the television.  In order to do so, you also have to buy the adapter for the Creative Zen player.\\n\\nI bought this so my Creative Sleek Photo would be compatible with an X-Rocker chair with built in speakers, and found that CD players and many other audio units became compatible, too.  For that, it was worth the cost\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am running the RadioShark on a G4 PowerBook w/ Mac OS X 10.4.  I am very happy with the programmed recording - saves to a variety of formats, etc. Very handy! The unit did all that it promised, but it could have had much better software. A Dashboard Widget is also included that controls basic operation, but not recording or EQ.\\n\\nNeeded additions:\\n1. Station presets are selected from a drop down menu??!? One has to go to the RS menu bar (top of screen) to find the favorite Stations - kind of klunky. Better to have \"radio buttons\" associated with the App window. To be fair, the Widget does have better station selection, but the button is labeled with a \\'heart\\'...\\n2. No station \"scan\" function. One has to dink through the entire spectrum manually - wow - hard to understand this lack of functionality.\\n3. Some additional audio filter/edit functions could be included. There is a multi-band EQ that works well, mostly (see comment below). At minimum there should be a hiss filter and a hum filter with variable levels of effect. Also, one should be able to edit out unessential material from an audio file. Though, for Mac OS X there is a nice freeware app that can do this:  AUDACITY.\\n\\nOddities\\n1. When first installed, the output had static in it which was worse with the EQ on. Griffin Tech Support was not very helpful - as with most tech support offerings, they failed to grasp the actual problem and replied with unhelpful suggestions. Re-installed software and it began working well.\\n2. Initially did not seem to work well thru an external (powered) hub; now has no problems. Though, unit does work okay with a USB extension cable\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a total bargain. Not only was the price right, it works perfectly in the car, at home converting every radio to a stereo system for my iPod Nano.

All I wanted was decent sound for a decent price, but after trying various models of ear-buds and standard phones and returning them all I figured I was going to have to shell out some big bucks after all.  But, then I decided to pull the trigger on some cans made by a great old company from my youth that used to be THE only choice for headphones- KOSS of course!  And man- they still have it.  These aren\\'t the greatest phones I\\'ve ever heard, but for $20 (and it seems you can now get them for half that!) they easily compare to some well-known sets costing 3 times as much or more.  Finally, no awful hi-mid peaks that threaten to end my career as an audio engineer *cough cough Sony cough*.  They are fairly comfortable- I think I would rather have the traditional over-the-head band but you get used to these pretty quick.  These sound nice, full- the bass doesn\\'t thump like a lot of people like but to my ears it\\'s smooth.  And most important, you can listen for hours without ear fatigue.  Without a doubt, these are the best budget phones I\\'ve ever owned!  My bottom line- anyone who doesn\\'t grab these for $10 bucks a pop is insane.  Period *g\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve tried several different brands of headsets and this one wins. It reduces noise, has excellent sound and is comfortable for hours at a time. My office is between the shop, where we make rocket engines, and the flight line on the airport, where airplanes are tested. Sometimes jet aircraft sit outside my window and perform engine run-ups, or idle the APU for hours. This headset reduces the white noise while still allowing me to hear the phone ring even when a local F-4 Phantom II tests the afterburner.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nGood price. Good company.

We are very happy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve bought several of these cables and have been very happy with my purchase.  I\\'ve used them for hooking up my Gaming Systems, TV, Cable Box, and Receiver/DVD Player.  (Note: I had to buy a small 3 in 1 Fiber Optic Switch Box to handle all these cables -my Receiver and TV only had one digital audio connection each.)\\n\\nI believe that these cables are the best name brand VALUES currently around for Fiber Optic Audio.\\n\\nWhat do you REALLY get for a \"high end\" fiber optic cable that is triple the cost of this cable? I don\\'t know.  I purchased one (which was \"top of the line\") and obscenely expensive, and of course it sounds great, but these cables sound great too.  Plus, these cables ARE Monster cables, AND they are THX certified!\\n\\nWhat does THX certification mean? Below is a blurb taken directly from the THX website describing it:\\n---\\n\"THX is on the forefront of entertainment technology, offering products and services of unparalleled quality for post-production, distribution and playback of audio and visual content. THX Certification is considered a mark of excellence in the presentation technology industry, offering consumers a promise that the cinemas they visit and the products they purchase have been evaluated and tested to meet the highest standards for picture and sound performance.\"\\n\\n---\\nA digital signal is a digital signal.  This is fiber optic cable -it uses light to transmit the digital data -it doesn\\'t degrade like analog based on the quality of the cable.  So these cables are NOT likely to give you a worse audio signal than more expensive cables, they just are going be a little less durable, and probably use slightly less high quality materials.  Are they fragile? Not at all, but the top of the line cable that I purchased was so thick that I probably could have stepped on it on cement and it would have been fine. This THX cable is thinner and I could imagine it breaking more easily.  If you work somewhere (like a studio) where there is a good chance of rolling things over the cables from time to time on a hard floor then you might have a good reason for a more durable cable.  (Same goes for cables that are going to be manhandled regularly -i.e. a lot of plugging/unplugging and bending of the ends).\\n\\nOverall, I\\'m very happy with these cables and can I afford to buy a bunch for all the fiber optic audio connections I am now using (i.e. Receiver, TV, Cable Box, Xbox/Playstation/Gamecube)\\n\\n(P.S. for first time users, don\\'t forget to pull off the tiny plastic coverings on each end of the fiber optic cables.  These are there to protect the cable during transit/storage and will prevent the light from passing unless removed.  Throw these tips away; you\\'ll never need them again.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had this phone now about 3 months and I am VERY HAPPY with it.

The range of the hand sets is great had no problem at all with this.  So far I love everything with this phone, It is much better than either of the last two phone I have had.

Fast forward one month and my opinion of the Cooler so far: not bad... \\n\\nMy laptop is noticeably cooler to the touch now, and the internal fan rarely comes on. The Notebook Cooler itself is smartly designed, with an aluminum topping and two fans that draw away heat. I\\'ll admit, the USB connector cable is a bit flimsy, and I can see why some folks have complained. For those users who travel frequently (or anyone who foresees plugging and unplugging the cable often), you may want to exercise extra caution. The blue LED light that some reviewer claims is too \"strong\" is a minor quibble--if you really wanted to, you could always tape over the light and problem solved. As for the fan noise, I would say the low setting is comparable to \"white noise,\" which you don\\'t really notice until you purposely try to listen for it! The high setting, on the other hand, is a bit loud, and I can see people having to turn up the volume on their speakers or TV to compensate. Usually, though, I only use the high setting when it\\'s really hot in the room, or if I\\'m running intensive programs like Photoshop or some video game. \\n\\nOverall, I\\'d say I\\'m very satisfied with this product. (Though, I am somewhat disappointed that Antec needs 3 months to process my $15 rebate check.) \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Logitech MX 400 mouse in my opinion was a good buy.  It is very reliable, accurate, scrolls smooth, and is precise and responsive on every surface I have used it on.  It is also light weight and comfortable, making it the purfect mouse for the price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought two pairs of these when I saw them in a store on sale for under $15 each.  They\\'ve both gotten extensive use over the past couple years.  The cushioning on the outside is cloth inside a black material that I suppose imitates leather in looks and feel.  This outer material on the cushions has worn off in flakes on both pairs, which makes it look raggedy, but the comfort and sound quality isn\\'t affected by it so I don\\'t consider it a big deal.   The headband adjust on one side of one pair seems to have had something break inside it which lets that earmuff go farther down than it \"should,\" but likewise, it\\'s something to be expected with this much use and hasn\\'t affected comfort.\\n\\nThe cable is also thicker than most headphone cables I\\'m used to, which is good news for people who find themselves constantly rolling over cables with their chairs and such.\\n\\nI\\'ve compared the sound quality to the Koss QZ-50\\'s (which I own) and a library\\'s Koss UR-10\\'s or 15\\'s (can\\'t remember which).  Though the QZ-50\\'s do sound better when they have their active noise cancelling feature turned on, the UR-20\\'s are the most comfortable of the three, have the richest bass, are the most durable, and won\\'t eat up your AAA batteries like the QZ-50\\'s\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently bought these speakers because I wanted to play my iPod in the office. The sound is better then expected.  While I would get a better speaker system for my home, for the office or on the go, these will do very nicely\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMyself and my grandchildren love to hold these adorable pets, their fun. lifelike and surprisingly sturdy. Get one!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhat a relief to find this mouse after having bought a Microsoft 6000 lazer mouse which caused my tendonitis to flare up again really bad.  I had originally gotten really bad tendonitis from another Microsoft \"ergonomic\" mouse a year ago, which became chronic, but barely noticeable until I tried the 6000.\\n\\nI also tried a Logitech V200, which is a good mouse, just not nearly as comfortable as the 450.  The buttons on both of these Logitech mice press down really nicely and are effortless.  This was not so on the MS 6000.\\n\\nIf you are looking for the ultimate in a mouse for a notebook, the Logitech V450 is it.  My hands are fairly large, and for the $15 more than the v200, it is definitely worth it as I spend a lot of time on computers\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis laser version tracks much better on odd surfaces compared to the Logitech V200 I have.\\n\\nThe Setpoint software allows you to use Setpoint\\'s mouse sensativity independent of the touchpad settings.  Finally!!!  I dont have to change mouse sensativities when I unplug it.  The Setpoint sensativity is an offset to window\\'s sensativity setting for the touchpad.  So basically, set your touchpad sensativity first, then adjust the Setpoint sensativity.  They will be work just the way you want everytime you unplug/plug the mouse and going back and forth between touchpad and mouse.\\n\\nPerfect product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nJBL speaker system for IPOD is an outstanding product, I would highly recommend it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a product too unique for me not too try.  I\\'ve struggling with lost receipts and always in a panic mode when tax day comes.  There\\'s just no other easy way I\\'ve found to keep track of all my receipts.  \\n\\nEven with some of the negativity about the accuracy on the receipt recognition, I still wanted to try this out for myself.\\n\\nI noticed the following will increase the accuracy of the receipt scanning:\\n\\n1) Scan your receipt ASAP once you have it.  Receipts are pretty cheap in quality and will fade over time.  Also for that matter, you risk the chance of loosing the receipt the longer you don\\'t scan it in.  =)\\n\\n2) Ink quality on the receipt matters.\\nIt does the best job when the dots of the letters/number are together and dark.\\n\\n3)wording on the receipt.\\ne.g. the receipt can say visa/mc then scanner will pick it as visa.\\n\\nBusiness card scans have been excellent for me.  Be sure to upgrade your sw to the lastest version.  Mine is 2.55 at the time of writing\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have used this and the optical cable.  For $20 less, it sounds just as good.  Monster cable is a great price point investment for anyone who wants to get the most out of their home theater system\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nExcellent antenna.  Why pay so much more for other indoor antennas such as Terk or Samsung. I tried both of those but ended up with the Zenith at a fraction of the price and with much better reception\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI live in Manhattan on the 7th floor of an apartment building surrounded by taller buildings on all sides and this antenna provides great reception. I use it hooked up to an HP 3200 lcd tv with built-in tuner. It took me less than five minutes from package being opened to finding the best place for the antenna to sit for reception. The cable is a few feet long and the antenna itself light. I have it resting atop my center channel speaker. $20 is a great price to watch the hd content the major networks provide- especially for football\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is very comfortable and works very well.  It\\'s heavy enough that it doesn\\'t move around or push the keyboard, as some of the other types of wrist rests that I\\'ve used have done.  Yet it\\'s cushiony while sturdy enough to provide support. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI type medical reports for a living, up to 10 hours a day and 7 days a week. Without the wrist rest, my wrists would not be able to hold up. The wrist rest is the perfect size. It stays in place on the desk. The gel continues to be supportive, even after a year of working on it. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the back of the wrist rest that lays on the desk has a horrible smell. I can\\'t smell it while typing, only when I pick it up for cleaning. I wish there was the option for half stars - I\\'d give this 4-1/2 stars\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWorks well....Customer support from Garmin....more than excellent...One complaint..Very short battery life...Requires a 12 volt charging adapter...Windshield suction cup charge adapter is a must to use as a G.P.S....Also...Get a minimum 512 MB SD card for combo marine and street navigation....One plus is the brightness,unit size,and screen size....Do not keep it in your breast pocket while on the boat...Dont float..not waterproof..nuff said\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis product took less than 5 minutes to unbox, install, and work properly. Well built, and functions exactly as I would have hoped. I am impressed with the ability of the suction cup to stay attached, even in the summer heat of Las Vegas\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a very simple product that works as advertised. Easy to set up within MacOS X. I use the AirTunes functionality which is very cool. I don\\'t use the USB printing. While more expensive than other 802.11g routers/access points, the simplicity + AirTunes functionality make it worth the extra money\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis Uniden phone/answering system has been trouble free since we bought it three months ago.  Here\\'s a list of the other things about this phone that I like most:\\n1.  The corded handset base unit can be used to make and receive calls even when the electricity is off.  This, along with price, was the main reason I bought this phone system.  This feature is unusual for a cordless phone system.\\n2.  The controls on the answering machine are simple and intuitive enough so that you don\\'t have to refer to the manual when you need to set the clock or change the outgoing recording.\\n3.  Also, the answering machine has operated flawlessly so far.\\n4.  The battery life of the cordless handset has been excellent between charges.  At least a week, sometimes more.\\n5.  Voice quality of the cordless handset and the corded base handset are very good.\\n\\nHowever, there is something about this phone system that I don\\'t like.\\n--The cordless handset has a pretty limited range.  I had to locate the base unit in a central location in my 2,300 square foot house to get the handset to work in all rooms.\\n\\nBut overall I think the phone is a good buy, if you can live with the distance restrictions of the cordless handset\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVery effective inside a plane comparing to the other noise cancelling headphone I have. Sound is ok for what it does. However, in a moving vehicle, it actually distorts the music which is a surprise. My other noise-cancelling headphone does not do that. It appears to have a relative long lag time in creating the opposite noise-cancelling wave. By the time the opposite wave applies to the music, the intruding noise is over. Otherwise, no complains\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was debating over the PictureMate, Kodak Printer Dock 3, Sony DDP-FP50, and the HP Photosmart 475. I made the choice of the HP and I LOVE IT! The prints are 4800x1200dpi and look like real lab prints. I use the HP 4x6 boarderless Premium Plus photo paper with the HP Ink and the prints are just wonderful. Forget the other bad reviews because this printer beats them all. (...) The HP produces bright, vivid pictures designed to last a lifetime. The PictureMate is also alot larger than the HP 475. The 1.5GB hard drive is a plus as well. HP said that the remote is not included but they lied, they come with the remote and battery. Overall, this printer is the best I have own\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese DVDs are absolutely top quality, and you really need to use bad DVDs to know how bad they can get.  I ordered a pack a while ago and have burnt 7 discs so far.  Not a single coaster, and Nero data verification (I always do that for DVDs) has not brought up any errors ever.  BTW, the discs had a mixture of both large and very small files.  The burner is the DVD multi drive on my Dell Inspiron Laptop (1505).\\n\\nHowever, I should mention (to those who haven\\'t bought this product) why they are called Shiny Silver.  You know that print on the top of DVDs with lines and that matte finish?  Well, there\\'s no such thing on these DVDs.  The top looks a lot like the writing surface on the other side (other than the characteristic DVD color).  Anyone who has seen unbranded DVDs will know exactly what I\\'m talking about- No special surface; however  a felt tip marker works nicely to label the disks.  Huge cost cutting here I guess, but definitely not in the quality department.  I will buy again\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI burn a ton of DVDs and have used almost every brand out there.  Many have errors, even the top brand names like Memorex...etc.\\n\\nI have found the least amount of errors with this brand and the shelf life seems to be lasting.  \\n\\nI\\'ve switched all DVD media purchases to Verbatim.  They are by far, the best of them all.  Would recommend to everyone\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFirst off, these puppies sound good! However, there are things anyone intending to buy these earphones should know:\\n\\nThe sound is loud and crisp but definetely mid-trebley, as with most in-ear headphones. The low end is there, but for full effect, it takes to position the earphones just so in your ear canal at the right volume. Since they tend to slide out of the ear canal as one moves, this sweet spot is not very wide. That said, however, I recognize the difficlulty of delivering earth shaking bass in a device this small. Most bass-rich systems utilize either massive speakers/ woofers or chambered enclosures (or both) to deliver. Since the size of this type of headphones doesn\\'t permit for either big speakers or special chambers, maybe the thing to do is to use the human cranium as the resonating chamber! I am yet to find any in ear headphones that really deliver bass to die for. Such is the difficulty to get big bass in so compact a package. Maybe the 5 and 7 series are better in this regard (for the price they better be).  So if you really need earth shaking bass in your playback, look into buying those pricey phones.  The lack of such bass is the only reason \\ni didn\\'t give it five stars.\\n\\nAlso, the lack of colored LEFT (blue or white) &amp; RIGHT (red) tags on the earphones make it tricky to put on for the first time. I didn\\'t realize I had them reversed until the pain got so unbearable I just had to check.  So be careful.\\n\\nRiding while using them can be dangerous, since the sound isolation is so great one can barely hear jets thundering overhead. \\n\\nBang for the buck, ( I paid $69.99 on amazon), I really recommend these headphones to all but big bass aficionados.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchase two of these phones to add to our base unit. Very easy set up. Quality product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had slight confusion whether to choose the sony 64 MB memory stick, which is nearly the same price or this one, which has twice the memory capacity of the previous one. I choose this one for the better deal and to add to my surprise J&amp;R Electronics shipped it so quickly(You guys Rock!!!). This one comes par with sony memory media in every field. So why choose the one with lesser memory capacity. Choose this one and feed your camera with some memory space\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nDelivered on time, no problems setting it up (just followed the instructions to format it because I didn\\'t want the default format it comes with, which is less safe). It\\'s been running fine ever since I bought it. I can\\'t comment on the speed of access because, since I leave it backing up over night, I don\\'t really care. It\\'s all done in the morning anyway, so I don\\'t really need anything faster\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI like this unit. It is hooked up to an S-Video in from my Digital Cable Box, and uses a component video out to a Mitsubishi HDTV. Picture quality is very good; I\\'m very used to my high-quality Sony DVD player DVP-NS700P, but this one is very close. There is just a touch of graininess to the picture from the Cable box, but then I\\'ve not compared with other units. I think its more than acceptable. A DVD I burned played fine on the Sony..but...when I recorded one program, deleted it, and then recorded again, it would only play on an older Sony DVD player. My Sony DVD player is kind of touchy, anyhow. \\nAll told, I\\'d recommend this DVD recorder without hesitation\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI don\\'t normally write reviews on products but in this case I feel I must share the value and features of this product.  You can\\'t go wrong in selecting this player/recorder for your DVD needs.  The quick start guide is just that \"quick\" and well planned.  The people at Samsung know how to write manuals and this manual is the best I have seen well documented with pictures (in full color) and just that step-by-step for the novice.  The setup diagram is excellent.  The features are numerous you can throw any discs you have left over from other recording machines and through it in takes three seconds to intialize (any disc) and away you go.  One touch record starts immediately.  The quality is superb especially in High Definition. I couldn\\'t wait to get it after reading the reviews from the last Electronics Trade Show so I was able to get it from back East about three weeks ago. Finalizing discs is a snap and easy I have had difficulty formatting on other machines but the Samsung is so easy the on-screen menu is good and the remote is easy to navigate even with my big fingers! It will play mp3s, CDs, computer made DivX movies, Region 1 DVDs, Picture discs from your computer and you can make your own movies from your camcorder or video camera and burn on the fly.  You can also program your other electronics into the remote but you must know the manufacturer\\'s codes which they list in a handy guide.  If you are shopping for a multi recorder/player search no more get this one you won\\'t be disappointed\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this set of speakers expecting a piece of junk...I WAS TOTALLY WRONG!!! These are great, they give the bass right where you want it. Sometimes i have to turn the bass all the way down and it is still too much. Watch out these come on sale instores for around $8.00 sometimes. That\\'s where i got my 1st pair\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe sound range and clarity is quite good, they are comfortable. My only hesitation is the cord is too short for my purposes, I\\'d like to use it with my computer not a MP3 attached to my belt\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got my mini about nine monthes ago right before they were discontinued (which, in my opinion, was a big mistake on Apple\\'s part) and I absolutely love it! Mine is pink, and the color is so nice, the design sleek and seamless all around. It\\'s smooth metal casing is really nice and different. The clickwheel is smooth and I have had no problems with it.\\n\\nIt holds a little less than 1,000 songs due to different formatting, but it\\'s still a good amount; iTunes is easily understandable and functional as well. The ipod mini is approx. 1/2 of an inch think and slides into pockets easily, while not being as flimsy as the nano feels to me. The clickwheel is a great and fast way to scroll through hundreds of songs, raher than, as on my brother\\'s mp3 player, needing to press \"next\" everytime you change the song. The backlight is fine, and does it\\'s job; my one complaint on that would be that, as I mainly use it on the bus at 6:00 am, it is quite bright and hurts my eyes.\\n\\nAnother huge plus to owning a member of the ipiod \"family\" is the countless accesories that have become availible exclusively to them. I myself have a case, an iSkin which I have come to adore, high quality headphones and the iBass, which is another great speaker product for ipods. I\\'ve actually invested waay more on accessorites for my mini than it cost itself, but that\\'s how much I love it!\\n\\nFor having so many great features, this is priced very reasonably. Even when I got it and it was $200, I still felt that it was well worth the money. BUY THIS NOW!!!! it\\'s amazing!    \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI haven\\'t written any reviews for Amazon before, but when prompted for my feedback on this trackball, I had to respond.  I\\'ve been using one of these or its predecessors since the early 90\\'s when Kensington first came out with the \"Turbo Mouse\".  It was great then, and now it\\'s better.  This is as solid, smooth, and precise of an input device as you can get.  I don\\'t understand those others with buttons on the side that when you press them the trackball slides across your desk.  This baby stays right where you put it because your button presses go straight down.  You can use it with just the tips of your fingers or your whole hand -- your choice.  The optical version is far superior to the old mechanical ones that needed frequent cleaning to stay in tip top performance.  The only drawback is the $100 retail price, but frankly it\\'s worth that.  It\\'s a no brainer at $80 which is what I paid through Amazon to Tiger Direct.  If you need (or want) a high performance trackball that you\\'ll be able to use with many computers to come, get this one\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese speakers are awesome for the price.  They charge your ipod even when the unit is off.  The sound quality is great for around 50 bucks.  I bought these for traveling and they are small enough to fit in a suitcase without taking up too much room.  They also stack so they don\\'t take up much counter space.  I can\\'t say enough about the sound quality.  They are great\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI work for a small sized consulting engineer\\'s firm where everyday we have to scan some hundreds of pages of text (magazine articles, old projects, letters from the client, books, etc).\\n\\nWe got four years ago our first fujitsu scanner ( still working ) and we have been impressed with its speed, small size and since it wase easy to use to obtain good quality PDF files.\\n\\nA couple of years we moved to the scansnap series. We now have four of them.\\n\\nPROS :\\n- incredibly easy to use ( you don\\'t need to teach anybody )\\n- fast for PDF scanning\\n- great value for money ( includes acrobat 7.0 bundled )\\n- very small, perfect for a desk\\n- good construction quality, no one of our 4 scanners ever broke\\n\\nCONS :\\n- quality of the feeding roller is good but not professional. If you have to scan hundreds of pages you have to be on the scanner to avoid paper jams, double-feeding that some time occurs.\\n- not great quality for photographs scanning ( however difficult because it is not flatbed ).\\n\\nI strongly suggest it for small-medium sized businesses to scan documents.\\n\\nIf you have to scan hundreds of pages everyday or you need a high quality scanner for photos you can find something better. \\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe CD sound is like being at the concert. Hooking the radio up to a television makes the home theater experience even better. The  fm radio receiption is even clear. Great quality product. Worth the money\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThese are some great headphones with a few minor flaws:\\n\\nPros:\\n1. Great sound quality\\n2. Very comfortable\\n3. Light\\n4. Worry-free charging\\n\\nCons:\\n1. Achieving good wireless connection is not always easy, could require pressing the tune-in button several times\\n2. Interference noises could sneak into the broadcast\\n3. Turning them off could be annoying (requires precise timing)\\n\\nMy experience: I\\'ve had two pairs of these for over a year and I like them very much. I enjoy great sound watching TV or listening to music while everybody is asleep. This is really great, I can enjoy music at comfortable levels at any time of the day or night. The sound is much better and clearer than the sound produced by the speakers of the TV. You have the same clarity and volume even though you might be moving around the rooms away from the TV (closet or the garage for example). The headphones are light and very comfortable. I tried other brands and the aw771 were the most comfortable by far. So, overall wonderful product. However, there a few flaws to be aware of. Consider the following before buying. It might require several attempts before the unit tunes in at the right channel. Sometimes, turning the headphones ON results in poor reception if any at all. To correct this, you have to press the only button (power, search, and turn off) and wait until the unit picks the signal at the right channel. You might have to repeat this operation two or three times and it is a bit annoying. Once you get good reception, everything is ok although you might get some interference (alien noises) when you turn your head or move around. The last problem is with the turn off button (again the only multifunction button). You need to press and hold the button for a certain amount of seconds and release it in order to turn off the unit. That is not always easy and usually the unit comes back on. You think you turned it off but it is still on and if it\\'s not in the charger base you drain the batteries completely. Well, I hope my description is helpful. \\n\\nRegardless of the flaws, I recommend the AW771. I use them every day and best of all I enjoy great sound when other people are asleep. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have always run all of my media through my pc and my former speaker set (a Midiland 5.1 system) was thoroughly aged and falling apart I decided it was time to upgrade.  I wanted something that had incredible sound with both music and dvd\\'s.  I shopped around and came to the conclusion I would aim for the form factor speakers.  When considering this bose system, this MUST be taken into account.    \\n\\nFirst off, this system is expensive.  For just under 1000 dollars (doesn\\'t 999 sound sooo much better than 1g?) you get 5 bi-directional midrange speakers, the subwoofer unit, and speaker cable.  At this price it is very disappointing that bose does not include some sort of receiver, but no matter this leaves room for the customer to customize his/her choice to suit any personal needs and/or budget.  Bose includes 3 colors (white, silver, black) and all the speakers are well packaged and aesthetically pleasing with the exception of the sub unit (a large rectangular box meant to save space but does not). \\n \\nWhat brought me to look into this system was the specific size of the speakers and there general attractiveness.  For their size the bose do a very good job of reproducing any sound-granted they are paired with a competent receiver.  Anyone who has any qualms about this system should first consider what they are running their sound through, without competent equipment these speakers will not be on par with what you heard in the store.  \\n\\nOnce I got the system home it was very easy to set up and install.  Bose packages the speakers with clear instructions and all of the wires are meant to be hidden and include markings as to what speakers they belong to-a very handy feature especially when one is trying to hide this system.  The only serious issue I have with this system ended up being with my receiver (an Onkyo) and not related at all with the speakers.  \\n\\nSince I do run this through my computer (presently a laptop) I had a few troubles setting up a new sound card and getting it too mesh with my receiver, but when that was all said and done, I was extremely please with the system.  With a bose the tweaking one needs to do is very minimal and thus why this deserves the higher price tag-its target audience is usually those more affluent and unable to spend hours tweaking individual speaker levels and sound ranges.  \\n\\nMy test soundtracks included:  Gladiator, Matrix (II or III), Snatch, and music tracks ranging from techno, rock, classical, and alternative.  Everything sounded great with enough low, high, and midrange response.  The second complaint I have with this system is not differentiating in the least between any of the satellites.  I found myself turning the response on the center channel up so the front speakers weren\\'t drowning out the voices.  That was solved with a little tweaking so nothing major there.  \\n\\nAll in all this speaker system is a great investment in my mind satisfying all of my needs (though draining my bank account) and providing me with great surround sound.\\n\\nGood:  Great range and volume of sound.  Easy set-up.  Well built speakers-aesthetically and physically.  No interference or feedback.\\n\\nBad:  Subwoofer awkward, no dedicated center channel, pricey, no included receiver.\\n\\nFor their size these speakers more than compete with any full-blown tower 5.1 system.  Here is one satisfied customer\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nLadies and Gentlemen,\\n\\nJust a quick note to say that it is a pity that people buy \\'toys\\' before exploring what it is that they\\'re buying.  I have seen people knock the SanDisk U3 drives, as well as U3 drive made by other companies.  Well the reality is that:\\n\\na- The U3 software has a way of stopping the software\\'s auto-boot.\\n\\nb- There is Uninstall software available at at SanDisk.com and at U3.com, and I\\'m guessing that those company\\'s that offer U3 and have a web site probably have the \\'Uninstaller\\' on their site.\\n\\nc- There is a great deal of U3 software available (free and pay-for-it) at U3.com.  I know that SanDisk has a software site, so do Verbatim &amp; Memorex.\\n\\nd- For those who want portable software but don\\'t want U3 or don\\'t have a U3 drive, go to http://portableapps.com.  Note: some of the software here is the same used by the U3 folks, without using the U3 LaunchPad.\\n\\ne- Quality of drives: remember that when you buy most of the electronics \\'toys\\' available today, you are buying Chinese c*** (junk).  Both the manufacturing and Quality Control (QC) are garbage.  Unless you are paying serious change for something ($500+) you will get passable junk.  If you are expecting \"made in Japan quality\" your kidding yourself.  This is the reason you will see many Brand Name goods, also selling with No-Name labels (i.e Coby).  Same production line, different labels.  It is also one of the reason folks are impressed with Apple iPods.  Apple demands excellent QC, and the destruction of goods that don\\'t meet the standard.  In exchange you are willing to pay a 20% premium for this level of QC.  Like everything in life, ya gets whats ya pay for.\\n\\ng- Since the beginning of Windows (v1.0, et al) there have always been buggy and uncooperative software programs, there will always be pain in the a** software.  One of the reasons XP has such a prominent \\'roll-back\\' feature.  And also the reason many, if not MOST, power users run multiple machines.  Of course, these days we have to fill Billy G\\'s pockets by having to buy multiple paks of XP.  Most of my power-user friends run at least three or four machines, each one with a different use.  It shouldn\\'t be this way, but the reality is that for folk that use or explore a great deal of software, for many purposes (MP3\\'s, scanning, Video, controlling radios, composing music, et al), one machine won\\'t cut it because XP ain\\'t as stable as folks think.  The more programs, and the more varied in type, the more instability is introduced into ANY Windows installation. Why do you think businesses run Win2000 or Win2003, because there are less software \\'toys\\' that run under 2K, and the \\'admin\\' can prevent you from loading a lot of software \\'toys\\'.\\n\\nh- In the end, understand what you are buying before you buy so that you\\'ll have better luck getting what you want, and you won\\'t look so ignorant when you say something that anyone who has bothered to go to the web site(s) knows is dead wrong, or just plain stupid.\\n\\ni- When you truly understand the product, you\\'ll be able to write TRULY useful reviews, and that what all readers want, useful information.\\n\\nTo one and all, may your \\'toys\\' keep you happy\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nVery easy to use. Expend my wireless network access from two marginal to five with very good signal level. No external power required. Highly recomend it.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nCould not have been easier to install - literally just put the included CD in the drive, and plug the device into your USB 2.0 port.  Installed and self-configured in minutes.  Very small, light, no additional power cords to worry about, no additional software (beyond the automatically installed drivers) to install - quick and easy.  Only issue I found is that the antenna is permanent, so you could never swap for replacement/better antenna like you can on some other wireless NICs\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis cover is very durable, however it is somewhat difficult to get the ipod into the case.  The case covers the entire ipod except for small vent holes so it is very water resistant, but the case covers the locking button making it harder to lock and unlock the ipod\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this answering machine with the intention of expanding the quantity of phones to cover the entire house. To start, I bought only one additional phone. I\\'ll buy the rest later. So far I am very pleased. The sound quality is excellent and there are numerous bonus features that I have found very useful. Like the talking caller ID and being able to screen messages from any of the phones. I also like being able to program a phone directory into one phone and transfering (download) a single entry or the entire list to the other phones. And each phone is also a speaker phone and a full intercom.\\n\\nYou can name the phones for the rooms they will occupy which will help when you use the intercom to call a specific room. So you would page the \"Living Rm\" rather than phone #3, etc.\\n\\nIf you have caller ID, you can program special rings and special call ID colors for the callers in your phone directory but that information must be programmed into each phone. It doesn\\'t transfer when you download the directory to the other phones. \\n\\nAlso, on another Panasonic wireless phone that I own, the incoming call displayed the name I had programmed into the phone directory. Just like your cell phone will say \"home\", etc. On this phone, the caller ID displays the telephone company info only. \\n\\nI think the phone is great, I just wanted to clarify some points that are not crystal clear in the literature.\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nKingston\\'s 2GB Data Traveler USB drive is perfect to storage files.

I had problems installing the unit and was on the telephone with HP Tech support (India) for 1.75 hours, I spent very little time on hold.\\n\\nThe largest draw back to the unit is my computer acts like the DC4000 is not there from time to time and required me to reboot the computer in order to use this nifty device\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently began upgrading my home audio by buying at Ebay 2 pairs of JBL E20s and 1 Pair E30s, an E25 center speaker and a Harmon Kardon AVR. I got the first pair of e20s a week ago and the 2nd pair of E20s and the E30 yesterday and the remaining stuff should be delivered by the weekend. \\n\\nThe E20s and E30s are listed as \"Bookshelf Speakers.\" The E20s ARE bookshelf speakers. As I wrote in my review of the E20s, the E30s can only be thought of as bookshelf speakers if you last name is Kong and your first name is King! The E20s are heavy at 7lbs each, not flimsy little boxes as some cheapo bookshelves are. The E30s are HEAVY. HEAVY! 16 lbs each. (That is what my 7 qt lodge cast iron dutch oven weighs!) They are 15 inches high and 12 inches deep. They need to be placed on small end tables or speaker stands 18 to 24 inches off the floor. \\n\\nI am very pleased with both the E20s and E30s. For small speakers, the E20s have some oomph and can be cranked up. The E30s have OOOMMPHHHH. They WANT to be cranked up. Yesterday I tried them out by listening to my mp3 files of the Animals Singles and Paul Revere and the Raiders Kicks. When cranked up, the E30s sound at least 1000% better than the the E20s.  I hooked them up to my vintage JVC AV receiver circa 1989 that has 80 watts front and 20 watts rear power. At a little over half volume my ears began to hurt. You can really feel the bass and the drums kick. \\n\\nI also listened to about 2 hours of The Doors via Rhapsody with the audio out from my computer to the audio in on my receiver. I have been listening to this music since it was first played on the airwaves back in the 60s. The E30s are simply incredible! They brought some very familiar tunes to life and made them new and fresh.\\n\\nMy biggest surprise with the E30s is that they sound very good at lower volumes, not as good as the E20s, but still very good. As I write, I am watching/listening to a DVD of Vivaldi\\'s 4 Seasons concertos performed by Herbert Von Karajan, the BPO and Anne-Sophie Mutter on fiddle and am running the E30s and E20s at about 15% volume--pretty low since the 4 speakers are sharing the front 80 watts of my receiver. Yet I can still HEAR everything at low volumes including the resonating violins and the harpsacord. Since we normally do not rock the house down all the time and we do often listen at lower levels, I am very pleased at how good they sound without having to blow out my eardrums. \\n\\nI bought the E30s for under $90 including s/h. Back in the early 80s or late 70s I spent more than four times this amount (adjusted for inflation) for 2 large, heavy Advent Loudspeakers with 8\" woofers. The E30s clearly sound better than I ever remember the Advents sounding including better bass response, and I liked the Advents! Over time, our audio choices have gotten better and cheaper. You still can spend mega bucks and buy a $10,000 McIntosh system (or even drop that much on a turntable magnetic cartridge as I saw at one website!) It all depends on what your budget is. The JBLs are a great value offering tremendous perfomance for those who are budget minded\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI repartitioned the disk so I have a Macintosh partition and a Windows partition.  I back up both my Mac and my PC to this disk.  It is fast and easy to use\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI use the drive to back up important data. I write a few GB to the drive each time. I was surprise by how fast data transfered onto the hard drive through the USB2.0 interface.

A cable of stunning, high resolution that snaps the picture into such clarity that you\\'ll think you\\'re watching scenes through a glass window and not through a television/monitor, a bold claim indeed, BUT, quite true never-the-less. I was totally unprepared for such a dramatic change for the better. This cable brings to the viewer ALL the picture, and, yes, that does mean \"Warts and all\"so, be prepared to see the smallest of detail, like strings and wire that enabled special effects crews to do their work \"Un-seen\". Who really needs HDTV when cables like Monster\\'s MVS3-1M are this good and can bring a vastly superior standard to an existing television/monitor for only a minute fraction of the cost. Thanks Noel, well done\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI stretched them till they fit comfortably on my wide head. They sound great to my ear and I use them alot\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can\\'t beat that price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is an affordable option that provides a lot of memory and allows USB 2.0 protocol for very fast transfer. If you need to transfer data from one digital product to another, this is very handy and I think that every person dealing a lot with data should have one.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI basically bought these because they were cheap. Cheap things are not always bad and these headphones are a great example. The UR-20 provides excellent sound for both music and movies. It has excellent bass and sound isolation. I am by no means an audiophile but I know good sound when I hear it and these headphones produce great sound, especially for its price.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNot a bad battery deal. While they don\\'t last as long as some other batteries I\\'ve tried, their cost per battery more than makes up for it. For those that care about such things, they contain no mercury, no cadmium, and are made in China\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve had this keyboard a number of years and would never go back to anything else. I have (or had) severe carpal tunnel syndrom. This keyboard has eliminated that problem entirely. I can\\'t think of a downside. Yes, it takes a bit of getting used to and yes, the keys are a bit noisy. But I have no problem with that. It just reminds me I\\'m working.\\n\\nThe number pad is excellent too.\\n\\nI\\'m getting ready to get another one to use with my laptop.\\n\\nYou can\\'t destroy this keyboard. If you value your wrists and hands, get this\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe previously had an AT&amp;T cordless w/answering machine (1 handset) and always had trouble locating the one receiver - kind of like misplacing the TV remote. With 3 handsets, we are spoiled. Also our house has a few phone jacks but they are all located where we did not want a phone and no jacks in our den or living room. With the abilty to locate the phones anywhere in the house where there is an outlet, we were able to place one in our living room and another in our bedroom (which we can turn the ringer off).\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nCorded phones with features are becoming harder to find now-a-days.  My home needed one corded phone for sure fire communications during power outages, mobile phone down for whatever reason, etc.  This is one of the few corded phones with caller ID and no answering machine built in.  The greatest feature of this phone is it has a HOLD button so one can place a call on hold while one gets high tech cordless, etc.  Also with the built in speaker phone this phone is great in the kitchen.  Highly recommend this for your one corded phone in the house\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWow, who would\\'ve thought that you could get such amazing products, at affordable prices.  The staff\\'s friendly and responds quickly to any questions that you may have.  This is one amazing phone system (Uniden TCX905), I forgot that it\\'s a cordless. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBought this for my son who is in Iraq. He doesn\\'t leave his tent w/o it!!\\nStands up fine to the dust and heat with no problem. Has more room than he expected. The price was LESS than the smaller one he wanted from a competitor to Amazon.com.\\n\\nSO glad I found this one on Amazon instead\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m going to cover compatiblity, sound, and comfort.\\n\\nOVERVIEW.\\n\\nAlthough I wish these were as cheap as the IPOD, $39 + $6 shipping isnt bad either. I have done the heat treatment (using boiling water) and the headphones seemed to open up more. When the headphones came in the box, the ear pieces were really close together. So I can easily see how these bands can crack easily when put on your head.\\n\\nI plan to heat treat these again to spread them out more.\\n\\nSOUND.\\n\\nSound quality is excellent.\\n\\nCOMFORT.\\n\\nThe only thing I don\\'t really like is this style of headphone. I don\\'t really like the band to go around the back of my head, causing my ears to support the headphones. I like the ones that go over the top of your head.\\n\\nCOMPATIBILITY.\\n\\nI have a Inspiron DELL Laptop and these suckers can connect to it easily without using a transmitter. These can also connect to just about any MP3 player of all sizes (PSP also) because it comes with a small 8 mm jack extension cord.\\n\\nFEATURES.\\n\\nCoolest features with this compared to my other IR sony wireless headphones is that this can go through walls! About 3X feet away\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI am overall quite pleased with these headphones.  The sound quality is excellent.  I\\'ve not had any problems with interference, background hiss or anything of that nature.\\n\\nBattery life has been excellent.  I have not actually ran them all the way down to see just how long they\\'ll last, but I use them to listen to music at work for the better part of 8 hours a day and they haven\\'t failed me yet.\\n\\nThe only reason I would not give them 5 stars is that they can be a little uncomfortable after prolonged use.  I\\'m not really a big fan of this \"sport\" style of headphone, and probably wouldn\\'t have tried these if I hadn\\'t gotten them on clearance.  But, I found that after experimenting a little I was able to get them situated to feel pretty comfortable, even wearing them the better part of a workday\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe keyboard is good quality and the best product I could find for the price. I recommend if you are looking for a low profile keyboard w/numeric entry pad that takes a mimimum anount of desk space.  The keypad has the feel of a large notebook computer.  So makes a great docking station keyboard if you are used to the slim kepads on most modern laptop computers.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFirst off, let me say that this is a VERY impressive monitor.  My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\\n\\nInstallation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\\n\\nOne big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn\\'t true with all ViewSonics).  And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic\\'s claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  I have to admit that I wasn\\'t sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it\\'s going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  This is a really a fine monitor!\\n\\nNow for a few small negatives.  One reason I haven\\'t purchased ViewSonics in the past is that they put a fairly tall bar on the bottom of these screens to accommodate speakers.  I already have a fine speaker system set up and connected to my computer, so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  Additionally, those ViewSonic speakers always raise the monitor height up much higher than I\\'m comfortable with.  Strains my neck.  The reason I really didn\\'t worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  On this ViewSonic, the bottom of the screen is 5 1/2 inches above the desktop.  It\\'s not bad, but it\\'s going to take a bit of getting used to.  If all else fails, other monitor stands are available.\\n\\nAs with most electronic products these days, there is very little in the way of documentation.  The 87 billion language installation card tells diddly.  The .PDF manual that is installed on the computer simply says the standard self-explanatory things.  However, I found the interactive help program on the manufacturer\\'s website be quite useful in helping fix a few small problems, surprisingly.\\n\\nAll in all, I\\'m very impressed so far, and I\\'m really looking forward to using this monitor!  By the by, shipping from Amazon.com was amazingly fast: it shipped the next day, and it arrived the day after that.  I can\\'t complain about that speed!  My only question is why they would need a weight surcharge on this but could ship an extremely heavy wood lathe for free?  Go figure!  Anyway, a solid four stars for this monitor\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m using this AP, along with a Netgear 802.11g PC Card to test streaming live/recorded TV to other parts of my house.  Seems like a capable product even if I didn\\'t use the 108Mbps feature.\\n\\nHowever, be sure to update the firmware or the AP might not work correctly.  When I first received it, configuration was easy enough but it had trouble working with my Netgear and HP Centrino notebook.  Both notebooks will get a signal and even connect be failed to obtain an IP address from my network\\'s DNS server.  A firmware upgrade solved the problem and the AP now streams TV realibly from my living room to the kitchen.\\n\\nI noticed that there is are hordes of wireless APs around my house, I guess most neighbours are using some form of 802.11 wireless as well.  However, this D-Link AP is able to function correctly abeit all the other APs around (2 using the same channel as mine I\\'ve found).\\n\\n\\nOverall, recommended if you want a good AP.  Just be sure to update the firmware\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe sound quality is pretty darn good, except that if you pace around while talking/listening, there are these annoying clicking/scratching sounds.  They are quite, and, if you stand still they go away.  I\\'ve had other phones that click/scratch while pacing around, and they actually dropped some of the sound during the clicking - at least this phone doesn\\'t do that.  \\n\\nMy 900 MHz DSS Uniden didn\\'t have these sounds (while pacing or otherwise), and still had greater range.  I don\\'t know why the new technology can\\'t measure up.  Still though, this is the best 5.8 I\\'ve tried.  (Yet I\\'d rather buy another 900MHz DSS if there were any on the market anymore.  All of today\\'s 900MHz are analog instead of digital.)\\n\\nAnother annoying thing is that you can\\'t recharge the phone with the belt clip attached, so the clip goes on and off (and on and off).  (Many (cell) phones have a charger that allows this.)\\n\\nThe plastic is a bit cheap.  Don\\'t drop this phone.  My friend has one and it hasn\\'t worked since it was dropped.\\n\\n(I haven\\'t tried the bluetooth yet, and have yet to see how good the battery life is.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got this base and added 6 TCX805 handsets to it.  The whole setup works great.  I got this base because it supports bluetooth through to my cell phone.  That features works well, there\\'s a slightly longer pause as it connects through to the cell phone but that\\'s trivial.  I will say this, you need to keep your cell phone within about 20\\' of this base.  I just take mine off, turn on Bluetooth and it automagically pairs up with the base.\\n\\nSo if you want the cell dialing feature and like the more traditional upright handset, get this base and expand it with other handsets. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis product is great - allowed me to connect a distant printer to my computer by hooking two of the extension cables together.  Worked right away - no problems\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a great headset for my use.  It is very clear.  I use it for work, and I only make use it periodically throughout the day, making about 10 calls daily so I don\\'t wear it all the time\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nResearched a lot before I bought this TV and for the money, this one was hands down the best 32\" LCD.   Also, Amazon had the best price by far and it shipped to my house in a timely manner with no major issues.   \\nI mainly use this TV for my XBOX 360.  You will NOT be disappointed if you are planning on doing the same.   The game mode does enhance the picture a great deal as well.  I provides sort of an Anti Aliasing effect smoothing out some of the rough edges. All in all, after owning the tv for about 2 months now, I couldn\\'t be happier.   To get around the poor speakers, I just plug in a nice set of headphones and games sound GREAT.  \\nI\\'ve also hooked up an HD antenna and regular cable.  HD channels have a very good picture over the air.  Some football games almost look better on this than on my 42\" Samsung DLP downstairs with the HD Cable.  There\\'s also a nice Antenna button on the remote which quickly swaps between cable and the Over the Air Antenna.  \\nThe only drawbacks to the TV are the 1 component input and the fact you can\\'t use the PIP with the cable connected, only the antenna.  \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had a Zen Vision:M but I returned it because I decided I didn\\'t need quite that much storage capacity and the hard drive seemed to sputter and whirr too often and I wanted the peace of mind that comes with owning a flash player compared to a hard drive player, so I decided to go with the Zen V since it\\'s interface is almost identical to that of the Zen Vision M\\'s(which I liked).\\n\\nThe first thing you will notice is the physical design.  Initially I wasn\\'t that impressed, but it\\'s really grown on me.  The height x width dimensions are comparitively much much smaller than the iPod nano.  You can actually wrap your entire hand around the device, and the soft finish feels very nice in your hand.  The second color that fills the seams of the player is a very nice touch as well.\\n\\nThe music is organized your standard Artist-Album-Song interface that is becoming quite a bit stale in my opinion. Still, it\\'s as simple as you can get I suppose.  The device officially supports album art although it seems to be very hit-or-miss in that regard in my experience. The screen is vibrant and colorful but is very hard to see in bright sunlight.\\n\\n The middle joystick is used for navigation and it works very well in that regard, although wedging your thumb underneath to move upward can be tricky sometimes and result in an accidental button push.  A dedicated volume control switch is found on the side and a hold switch on top.  \\n\\nThe player syncs with WMP11 via USB connection.  Syncing it is a snap although I was not impressed with the transfer speeds. Also, if you sync the tracks on your player back to another computer, album art will not be attached to the music tracks.\\n\\nIf you are a newbie to buying MP3 players make note of the different sized models.  The 2GB model for instance advertises that it holds 1000 songs but these figures are theoretical maximums based on low quality files.  Most of my files are mid bit-rate WMAs and I can fit about 500 songs on the player, half as much as advertised.  \\n\\nSummary:\\n\\nPros:\\nExcellent physical design\\nEasy to use interface\\nGood navigation\\nGreat sound quality\\n\\nCons:\\nOn-the-go playlist creation is flawed\\nAlbum art support hit-or-miss\\nSlow transfer speeds from WMP11\\nAccesories rarely available in brick-and-mortar stores\\n\\nUltimately, I recommend the Zen V over the iPod nano mostly on the strength of it\\'s vastly superior physical design. \\n\\n\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had these speakers for over a month and I love them they sound awesome. They were delivered quickly and they were brand new as described\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI read the other reviews for these speakers so I had very high expectations. I can only say WOW! The premium price (compared with lesser 2.1 speaker systems) is absolutely justified\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor reference, I\\'ve owned a set of Labtec APX-6420 2.1 speakers for about 6-7 years now. With the purchase of a a new computer (Mac Pro + Cinema Display) I decided it was also time to upgrade my speakers. I spent a very long time mulling over different brands and models, listening to them in stores whenever possible. Of the major \"PC speaker\" makers, I recall sampling Altec Lansing, Logitech, Klipsch, Bose, Creative, and JBL. Aside from listening in stores (a poor environment) I also took into account personal experience with the brands (mostly the first three I listed) in regular \"home\" situations.\\n\\nI initially wanted the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1\\'s because of the fantastic reviews they\\'ve gotten on Amazon and elsewhere, but was turned off to them because of the apparently poor build quality (parts breaking very quickly), along with reports of buzzing, the power switch being on the back of the subwoofer, my impression of them in stores, and experience with a friend\\'s ProMedia 4.1\\'s (which neither I nor him really cared for, and which recently broke).\\n\\nI tried as many Logitech speakers as I could in many different situations and  decided I HATE ALL OF THEM (with the sole exception of the Z-5500\\'s which I own and love)! The bass especially sucks on their speakers.\\n\\nSo... through all this I eventually came to the conclusion that Altec Langsing was the brand I wanted to go with. And if that was so, it had to be the FX6021\\'s which I had been eyeing for years. The first time I heard them in a store I declared them my favorite of the selection at the time and the same is still true. These are probably the best sub-$200 2.1 PC speakers you can buy. Even at their MSRP of $250 they\\'re probably worth it. These speakers a very nice!\\n\\nThe sound is very clear and sharp. Get ready to hear all the distortion in your low bitrate digital audio files. The speakers especially shine when listen to live recordings or anything that was produced by real instruments (i.e. not techno, though that sounds good too).\\n\\nSubwoofer is NOT \"boomy\" or \"buzzy\" like others have reported. I never use the equalizer in iTunes and have the bass at about half. It\\'s very deep, rich, and discrete. Doesn\\'t shake the floor or cause my neighbors to complain--yes, I live in an apartment too and bass is a concern of mine. For those who complain about the bass: maybe you shouldn\\'t have gotten 2.1 speakers? Maybe your units were defective? Or perhaps the subwoofer was placed in a very poor position? I know sound is highly subjective, but those reviews just don\\'t sound right to me.\\n\\nPROs:\\n* Tall, sleek, and sexy satellites provide a nice wall of sound and match the Cinema Display perfectly.\\n* Bass and treble have a *large* range of adjustability. 50% of either is plenty enough for me.\\n* Power button on control pod\\n* This is important: NO BUZZING. Not while they\\'re on, not while they off. 100% silent.\\n\\nCONs:\\n* Volume adjustment is digital and moves in \"notches\"; these notches aren\\'t always small enough. I much prefer a regular analog knob.\\n* Remote is a bit useless\\n* While they look good and perform well, they feel a little cheap\\n* Get ready for lots of cables hanging from your desk and all over the floor (on the other hand, long cables are a PRO as well)\\n\\nAnd finally, don\\'t be fooled by specs. Yes, other speakers may have more watts of power and THX certification, but that really doesn\\'t matter as much as it might seem. These are more than loud enough for any sane person (100% volume would probably wake up the neighborhood). I really didn\\'t pay any attention to the specs, I bought them because they sound the best\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'ve owned these Altec\\'s for over three years now, and I have yet to ever coming close to replacing them - as a matter of fact, when facing the decision of buying another set of speakers for a new computer, I went ahead and still purchased these babies!\\n\\nSOUND QUALITY --- the sound quality is very crisp and excellent overall - I have used mine for video editing, and I\\'m very pleased with how clear the dialogue audio has come through, in addition to the special effects sound - unless you need a five speaker system (or comparable) then I\\'m confident that this is the most crisp sound you\\'ll find in any speaker\\n\\nVOLUME --- these suckers can get LOUD - just take my word for it\\n\\nCOMPATIBILITY --- This is the part I love most - there is no software to install and no special plugs - the speakers plug right in, and very easily, into the audio jack, just like a pair of headphones would --- thus, hooking in a computer, iPod, cd-player, etc, is easy as heck, making these speakers extremely universal for any sound equipment\\n\\nCONTROLS --- the speaker system comes with a seperate remote, giving one access to adjust the volume, bass, and treble, all seperately from the computer\\'s controls -- the knob to control the volume, and other functions, is easy to use and makes for quick adjustments\\n\\nSIZE --- the speakers are extremely thin and the subwoofer is a very manageable size -- placing these speakers is easy\\n\\nPRICE --- believe me - it\\'s a bargain at under $200!!!\\n\\nOverall, I give my full recommendation here -- you\\'ll love these speakers\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nMy sound improvement wasn\\'t as dramatic as many people describe, likely because I already had my computer wired to a good reciever and speakers, but I did notice an improvement over the integrated system I have once I made some adjustments. If you listen to rock, pop, blues or jazz, this card can make everything seem a bit brighter and punchier. It also seems to improve Pandora internet radio streams even more than my mp3\\'s, though I have to keep the volume at about 3/4 in the Pandora player to prevent distortion. If you mostly listen to classical on a good stereo, I\\'m not sure if this card will do much for the sound, but it might\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI wondered what kind of mouse I would get for $60.  I kept thinking, what could be so special about it.  Well, I don\\'t know where to begin.  I like it so much, I\\'m getting ready to purchase another one just to use at work.  I used a Microsoft Explorer mouse prior and thought I\\'d never find a mouse that was as comforable to use and had all the extra buttons I needed.  This mouse completely puts the Explorer to shame.  It took me a few minutes to get used to how quickly it responds but I soon caught on.  I really didn\\'t care for the glowing or the chameleon paint on it.  That\\'s not why I got it, although it does look pretty cool.  As for gaming, I really didn\\'t notice much improvment in my skill but it REALLY does feel better in your hand.  The bottom of the mouse it curved in so you can grip it much easier.\\n\\nMy only negative comment towards it is how cheesy the driver and gui is for it as it looks \"homemade\".\\n\\nI would highly recommend this mouse for anyone who spends any time at all on a PC\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got the Razor Diamondback a few months back and have been very pleased with it\\'s performance.  For gaming it\\'s great, but I do not recommended it for everyday mousing around. \\n\\nThe resolution on the Diamondback was the selling point for me, and if that\\'s something your interested in you will NOT be disappointed.  It\\'s really super sensitive and has improved my accuracy quite a bit.  I do have a few gripes with it\\'s design, but with 1600dpi that can be overlooked!  Oh, it looks cool when the lights are out the chameleon green paint is a trip.\\n\\nDesign problems that I have noticed... Buttons squeak, button placement is not optimal, it\\'s kinda small for people with big hands, programmable buttons take to much force to operate which can cause erratic mouse movement. If you have a second mouse to do your work with this makes a great gaming specific mouse, highly recommended\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI decided to upgrade my laptop with the wpc54gs from the wpc54g.  I did this because the \"g\" card would randomly disconnect when the WEP or WPA security was activated.  Living in a home near about 6 other networks I really wanted the router and wireless network secured.  So, I purchased this card to see if it would fix my problem.  I can happily say it solved the random disconnect with WPA security turned on.  The range is just fine and all my network connections seem solid.  Have not had a disconnect yet, over the last 5 hours.\\n\\nThe reason I took away one star is the fact on the Wireless Network Monitor V2.1 there seems to be a flaw.  When I connect to the network and internet the monitor says it is hooked to the network but unable to find the internet.

I am quite pleased with my purchase. Though not stellar audiophile quality, the sound is pretty darn good, and with some minor EQ it\\'s excellent. The noise cancelling effect seems to work very well: much better than I expected. Furthermore, the headphones are very comfortable and seem to be solidly constructed. I highly recommend them\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI recently bought a new 6.0 megapixel digital camera (Canon PowerShot S3 IS) which came with an extremely small and  practically useless 16MB secure digital card so I bought a couple of these 1GB PNY PSD1GRF3 secure digital cards since they were on sale for less than $20 apiece.  These SD cards are made in Japan by Toshiba (they are then rebranded and sold by PNY, Lexar, DaneElec, etc.) and I have been very pleased with them so far.  They work flawlessly with no write-speed delay in my new camera while shooting still pictures or while shooting video with stereo sound, and the card reader in my HP Pavilion M7480N Media Center PC (running Windows XP Professional service pack 2) reads the pictures and video into my Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 2.0 software programs with no problems.  The only drawback is that the read-speed on these standard SD cards is a bit slow when compared to the newer and faster SD cards...it takes several minutes to transfer all the pictures or video from a full 1GB card onto my PC...but I find this to be a small inconvenience rather than a big problem.  So, if a little longer read time is not a problem for you, then save yourself some money and buy this card.  Overall, a very good standard SD card at an excellent price!     \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThere isn\\'t too much to write about this except is delivers as stated.  Great product for the price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI set up a small security program with my Macintosh. Intially I needed a PC to place the settings in the camera, however once I got it hooked up to my security system it works beautifully. I would recommend you leave the lights on though because if you don\\'t you will be getting just a black, fuzzy dark image back if you are using this camera for security.

I wanted a new one with wireless technology and I was driven to Bluetooth just because it is so reliable. I do not use the keyboard and mouse together, however.\\n\\nThe keyboard is one of the most comfortable keyboards I\\'ve ever used. I am a computer programmer so having a nice keyboard is essential. The pad at the bottom is very comfortable and the keys are very well spaced and organized. The only real compliant is they cut some corners with the home, end, page up, page down, and delete keys. They moved them around from the conventional way which I still haven\\'t gotten used to but it\\'s fine.\\n\\nI have experience no lag with either the mouse or the keyboard. I play a game called StepMania (a sort of Dance Dance Revolution clone for PC) which requires very accurate timing with the keyboard. I\\'ve experienced no problems here, it\\'s spot on and probably the fastest ever. The only problem, really, is it takes a while to register if you haven\\'t use the keyboard for a while since it must turn back on from sleep mode and reconnect. After that however, there are no problems at all.\\n\\nI do not use the mouse with the keyboard. I decided to use it as a mouse with my iBook since it had built-in bluetooth. I had absolutely no problems connecting the two devices and it works flawlessly. I don\\'t use the mouse very much, but the times I do use it I experience no problems.\\n\\nBoth the range on the mouse and the keyboard are extremely nice. I can go anywhere in my room with either the mouse or keyboard and experience no problems.\\n\\nThe battery life on the keyboard is also very nice, esspecially since it has the built-in sleep feature. I have had to replace the batteries once since I got the unit in January of 06 (currently June of 06). I have not had to replace the mouse batteries yet, but I do not use it very much.\\n\\nOthers complained about not being able to use the keyboard in the BIOS or startup screens, but I haven\\'t had any issues with that. It depends on how recent your motherboard is, and mine is relatively new so I had no problems.\\n\\nI highly recommend this setup to anyone wanting a wireless keyboard or mouse, or if you want to split and use the mouse with a laptop and keyboard with a desktop. Either way, you cannot go wrong with this package, it is extremely excellent\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\n i recently purchased these speakers for my patio setup.  the sound quality wont blow your mind, but it does not sound bad.  its large and lound enough to hear for an outdoor speaker for the price. it has a switch in the back for outdoor/indoor.  not really sure what that does.  very easy installation with the brackets included.

Features such as caller ID and the speaker phone are powered by batteries.  As stated by another reviewer a set of batteries only lasts a few months, even if you do not use the battery-powered speaker phone often.

Worked like a charm...couldn\\'t believe it was that easy.  Great performance and good price from Amazon\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBottom line up front:\\n\\nWorks very well, very low price, works much better with the \\nincluded drivers than with the generic windows xp driver\\n\\nDetailed review:\\n\\nI bought this so I could use my new Treo 700w with my non-bluetooth-enabled laptop.  The price was my main motivation in buying it.\\n\\nInitially I just plugged it in and used the default windows xp drivers and it worked okay, however it didn\\'t always work and i\\'d have to unplug/replug for my phone and the device to find and talk to each other.\\n\\nAfter getting tired of that, I decided to install the drivers that ship with the product.  I\\'ve had a much better experience since i did that.  I was afraid the software would be really clunky given the cheap price, but it\\'s actually quite good and gives you a TON of options that the standard XP driver does not provide.\\n\\nIf you use a this with a laptop and you dock/undock it, you\\'ll have much better luck if you stop the adapter prior to docking/undocking.  Otherwise, you\\'ll probably end up having to unplug/replug it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a corded mouse; fits comfortably in your hand.  Moves smoothly across table surface; works well on a mousepad as well if you need wrist support.\\n\\nWorked out of the box (except for the application button) for the different buttons on the mouse.  The Internet buttons allow for a page forward/ back with your thumb.  There are also line up/down buttonw above and below the scroll wheel that allow for more control in scrolling.\\n\\nThe scroll wheel feel good, better than some other mice I have used.\\n\\nI opted to use the native Windows XP mouse driver, so the application button does not work, but the Windows taskbar is not much of a hardship :-); and I prefer not to clutter up my system with another set of marginal utility software\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt has very good definition but is slow, even in the night is not that good and is slower\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhile the product description states this battery is \"Compatible with Motorola T5320, T5400, T5420, T5600, T5620, T5700, T5720, T5800, and T5820 2-way radios\" the 53615 is compatible with many more.  To bad Amazon couldn\\'t put this online for us.\\n\\nFrom the packaging:\\nT4800 Series\\nT4900 Series\\nT5000\\nT5320\\nT5400 Series\\nT5500 Series\\nT5600 Series\\nT5700 Series\\nT5800 Series\\nT5900 Series\\nT6500 Series\\nFV500 Series\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this phone system as a gift. I set it up and used it extensively. The handsets have features that you are used to finding in a cell phone. Many different ring tones to choose from, the antenna lights up when a call comes in. You can even set special colors and ring tones for specific callers so you\\'ll know when they\\'re calling without picking up the handset.\\n\\nTalking caller ID is great too. No more rushing to find the phone only to discover it\\'s a sales pitch or a call that could wait.\\n\\nI set this phone up on a voice over IP cable modem phone and the calls are loud and clear. \\n\\nThe phone is running next to an 802.11b/g wireless computer network and has NO interference at all. \\n\\nOne suggestion to make the batteries last longer: Do NOT leave the phone sitting in the charger all the time. This will basically be constantly charging the batteries and will wear them out MUCH faster. Instead leave the phone off the charger until the battery alert beeps and the phone displays \"recharge\" on the screen. Then let it get a full charge. You\\'ll find that the batteries will not need to be replaced for a year or more instead of 6 months or so\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was looking for a new pair of headphones to compliment my brand new ipod nano when I ran across these on a website. I was a little hesitant at first because I don\\'t think I ever spent over $40 on a pair of headphones. I finally decided to invest in these because I spend most of my free time listening to music. I received these the other day, and immediately plugged them into my ipod. Please don\\'t let the breaking in period discourage you! After these become comfortable, you will hear music you have never heard before even when you are listening to songs you have heard thousands of time.\\n\\nI started with all my heavy bass tracks, and couldn\\'t believe how they sounded with these headphones. I then wanted to try some of my jazz and blues tracks to see how these tracks sounded. This is the first time in my life John Coltrane has given me goosebumps!\\n\\nIf you are debating on whether to spend this kind of money let me make it easy for you. If you are just a casual music listener, I would say just go with a good pair of cheap ones, you will save a lot of money. However if you are a passionate music lover and collector, these headphones will change your music completely. After getting comfortable with these, I would have paid much more than I actually did\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the Ultimate Ears Super fi model especially designed for \"bassheads,\" featuring a disproportionately large bass driver complemented by a more conventional driver for the middle and high frequencies. I don\\'t think UE would ever claim that what results is a balanced sound signature. Yes, the mids and highs are present and the quality is clean and reasonably detailed, but these frequencies are definitely recessed and with some kinds of music this can result in an unnatural kind of reproduction.\\n\\nOn the bright side, however, the bass reproduction is  marvelous. Not only is the quantity/extent of the bass frequencies as powerful as any headphones or earphones I\\'ve ever used, the quality is excellent. The bass is tight and pleasant, neither boomy nor thumpy. This overbalance toward bass frequencies renders the UE 5 EB\\'s ideal for use when listening to music in which the bass is presented \"front and center,\" including techno bass (aka \"car audio bass\"), drum n\\' bass, and many types of rap/hip-hop. For music in which the basslines are prominent but comprise part of a more balanced presentation overall, opinions will vary. With rock music, for example, the strong bass is certainly a plus, but I have found that sometimes the bass overpowers the middle frequencies too strongly, and some detail is lost.\\n\\nIt should be noted that this bass-dominated sound signature renders the EB\\'s a good choice for people who own iPods and feel that their music player is weak on bass. Without any EQ adjustment, the iPod suddenly is transformed into a player where the bass is PRESENT. \\n\\nIn terms of build, the EB\\'s superficially seem well-constructed and designed. I have heard complaints, however, that the thinness of the wires and earpieces render them vulnerable to breakage. Be careful out there! Thoughtfully, EB has includes a variety of ear tips with these IEM\\'s (including foam, flanged, and plain) so that users with different sized ear canals can get a good fit. The EB\\'s don\\'t extend deeply into the ear canal, which is a mixed blessing. On the one hand, this means that if you get a good fit of the earpiece into the entrance to the ear canal, comfort is good and isolation decent. However, if the fit is not quite right both comfort and isolation will prove frustrating. Making the right choice of ear tip is absolutely essential when using the EB\\'s.\\n\\nOh, and some people think that the EB\\'s look kind of strange when worn. Larger than the higher-priced Super fi 5 Pro model, the EB\\'s stick out a bit. Your call as to whether this is a problem.\\n\\nLike all of the UE IEM\\'s in this series, the EB\\'s are packaged with a nice set of accessories, including a 1/4\" adapter plug, a sound attenuator, a soft travel case, an earwax loop, and a silvery metal storage case which includes a winder that helps head off what is always a problem with IEM\\'s, cord tangling.\\n\\nIt\\'s unlikely that the EB\\'s will prove satisfactory as your \"everyday\" earphone unless you listen solely to bass-dominant types of music. The truth is, however, that even for bass-heavy music the overall sound signature of the Super fi 5 Pros is likely to be more satisfactory for most users (I own both). But as a second pair specifically for use with bass-y music, the EB\\'s are well-designed and definitely fun\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nwe have this for our 30gb ipod and it works fine in both our cars.....very handy and a must buy!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the 2nd Gamepad I\\'ve owned (My first PC was in 1993).  The 1st gamepad was the Gravis Gamepad (4-button + D-Pad).  I recently upraded and there is no GAME/MIDI port on the new system, plus I need more buttons for Need For Speed Most Wanted, etc.\\n\\nI love this controller.  I\\'ve had it for two days and have had nothing but excellent results.  I\\'ve only used it in NFS games (I have them all).\\n\\nThe WiFi works flawlessly and I have a WiFi network in my house.  Installation is simple and takes maybe 3mins.\\n\\nThe rumble only works on games which have forced feedback software. This is totally understandable.  The feedback in NFS-MW is very slight but that\\'s not the controllers fault, it\\'s a matter of programming by EA Games.\\n\\nI like the weight of the controller.  It\\'s not feather light, so with that motor and battery weight added, it feels more like a premium device (just like the 67$ with tax I paid for it - canadian dollars).  I didn\\'t like how my gravis gamepad as so light, so this is a step up.\\n\\nThe analog sticks are a great for racing as they are progressive like a steering wheel.  They are rubber gripped for non-slip action.  I am used to the D-Pad, so I have mine setup in NFS to use both as a directional control without having to press the MODE button to switch because you don\\'t have time during a race to press a button before switching.\\n\\nIt works as well as my old gamepad, but feels betetr and has extra buttons and the other features listed make it worth the money.  If you in the USA, you\\'ll be getting a much better deal.  It lists for 60$ cnd here but only 30$ US in the states.\\n\\nCONS:\\n\\nIt\\'s not as comfortable to hold as I would like but its much better than my Gravis Gamepad and the buttons are easier to hit on the new one.\\n\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\nI\\'m very satisfied overall and I knew I may have to get used to the way it feels when I hold this controller since changing from the old SNES style Gravis Gamepad.\\n\\n4/5 rating only because it could be easier to hold\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe have had this phone for almost a year and I love it. We have the base station which is also an answereing machine  plus we have  a sattelite phone.  I wish we had more satelite phones.

I just wish the extra phones were not so expensive to add on. \\nGreat phone buy it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe system worked out of the box allowing me to quickly link up additional devices in an in-home office which had a single network connection.

Its a great design, tons of features, MP3 ring ton, Picture Caller ID, Sync with your PC for phone book, Answering machine, etc.\\nI am very happy with.\\nThank you so much for such great product with a great price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI work at a home office so I am on the phone lot.  I always buy cordless phones I can use with a headset so I can have both arms free while I talk with a min of background noise intrusion. In other words, I don\\'t talk with the phone cradled between my shoulder and ear. And I don\\'t use speaker phone features. Let\\'s just get that out of the way now since those are things some have complained about that I couldn\\'t care less about.\\n\\nThis phone first of all looks good and FEELS good. It was built with high quality plastics and metals on all surfaces. It has a nice solid weight to itself. Nothing tacky or cheap about it. It looks far better in person than it ever did in pictures. And it looks pretty good in pictures. I like how the bases are designed such that the antennas serve a double purpose as cradle supports for when the phone is docked. Clever design. The charging base light and back-lit buttons all look very slick.\\n\\nThe screen is attractive. A big step up from back-lit LCDs or no screen at all like my previous phone.\\n\\nI like that you can very quickly find and hit Mute, adjust volume, and page through your caller history.\\n\\nThe belt clip goes deep so the phone stays snugly attached to you pocket when you are walking around.\\n\\nI know many 5.8 GHz phones don\\'t mention that only one direction of communication is at that frequency vs. both directions (as 2.4 GHz sometimes gets used too). I don\\'t know for sure if this phone falls into that category, but I was in the market for a 5.8 GHz phone to avoid interference with my WiFi networks as well as to avoid microwave oven interference with my calls.  One thing\\'s for sure: this phone definitely is immune from MY microwave oven. In the past when I was on a call heating up my coffee, static and voice quality went way down unless I got far away from the oven. With this new phone I can stand right by it while on High w/o ANY impact on voice quality.\\n\\nOne other very cool feature is the spare battery charger. While it\\'s nice that the battery can replace a unit that runs down in a handset right away, the best part is if you have a power failure. Your phone will keep truckin\\' and there is never a need to replace that battery with some short lived 9volt waste of time.\\n\\nFinally, I like how the phone by a bedside basically doubles as a digital clock. The phone base unit picks up the current time from the caller ID info provided by the phone company and uses that info to automatically set and broadcast the current time to all headsets and base station. No need to manually set the clock. And when not in use, sitting it is dock, the phone\\'s screen displays the time.\\n\\nSo far I\\'ve found the voice quality to be best of any cordless phone I\\'ve owned\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this for my kids computer when I bought a new one for hubby and myself... these speakers sound better then the more expensive ones I have.... \\n  \\n I highly recommend these speaker\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\ni wanted a top quality palm with the bells and whistles.  this is pretty close to it but i had a few problems with the email and web features.  granted i am not a techie, but connecting and checking email should be more straightforward.  all the other features are top notch and overall i love my palm\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this item for a long trip so I could charge and/or play my Zen mp3 player in the car without worrying about battery life on the trip.

I am also planning to use it for my notebook in the car the same way because the car adapter for my notebook costs $100\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have searched and searched and searched for a pair of portable headphones that sound as good as these with lots of failure. IMO, you cannot beat the sound of a set of \"over-the-head\" headphones. I have tried all styles: earbuds, behind the neck, clips, even the ear plugs. Nothing gives the sound and comfort of the KTX Pros (granted, I have never tried the sportapros or portapros, but from what I have read, they are the same headphone. Except they are UGLY!). The KTX Pros have both great lows and great highs. Plus, you can\\'t beat that price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFor the price is is great.\\nit\\'s working fine but the plastic is not solid and has a feeling of low quality. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI thought that this flash drive was above average in performance. Works well between a Macintosh and a PC. I liked the feature--missing from my last flash drive--of easily emptying the drive after use without having to some fancy erasing techniques. In other words, the PNY worked like a real hard drive. I would like the manufacuters to explain in detail how to attach the tread to the laniard. It took me a while to figure it out\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWith so many of these ipod speaker docks on the market, it was sort of struggle to decide.  Ultimately, I felt very comfortable going with the Bose brand.  Plus, in my opinion, this is about the sleakest and best-looking unit out there (I went with black; I\\'m not an Apple-white drone).  The sound is very, very good for small to medium size spaces.  There are not a lot of features to the unit, which I think is a good thing - it just focuses on the sound and the small footprint.  Mini remote control work well and again the small size makes it unimposing in this world of too many remotes.  Power cord is plenty long and I like the fact I can easily move the thing to a different room if I need music there\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWell, the bose sounddock is a wonderful music dock.  Its VERY simple. just put your ipod on there and ROCK OUT TO THE BEAT. The bose quality is very obvious, and it looks like you could spend 300 dollars on it, which brings me to my next point. ITS TOO EXPENSIVE. my recomendation is to buy an FM transmitter and listend to your ipod on any Fm raido.  The only disadvantage of an Fm transmitter to this is that this will charge your ipod, and its slightly easier(but thats what iPod is all about, isnt it...?)\\n\\nBasically, im saying buy it if you have a lot of mone\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m a jogger, and like to listen to All Things Considered while I run miles and miles.

I bought those big boxes of 100 sheets of Kodak\\'s photo quality glossy from Costco.  My prints were blotchy.  Then I got my hands on some of Canon\\'s Photo Paper Pro, and my pictures were magically crystal clear.  The difference is amazing.  I never would\\'ve thought paper would make this much difference.  I\\'ve since bought Canon\\'s 15 sheet packs multiple times.  I now use the Kodak stuff for drafts or to give prints to people who don\\'t care much about the quality of the output, while I save the Canon Photo Paper Pro for prints we want to frame\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis stick is fantastic for high resolution photos and is lightning quick.

Highly recommend it for the money. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThose people giving these speakers low reviews because they don\\'t have enough bass are idiots.  I don\\'t know what people expect of these little speakers, but it is difficult to imagine them delivering as much bass as they do.  These are amazing little speakers that have accompanied me in all of my travels; from Paris to camping in Northern California.  I cannot imagine going everywhere without them.  They are not  equivalent to a $10k stereo system, but they are not meant to be.  All I need is my Zen touch or Zen micro and these speakers.  Do not listen to the other reviews, these speakers will make a decent stereo of your MP3 player.  Enjoy them anywhere\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have used VoSKY Skype Call Center (USB07051C-01) for about a year now as my only home Skype In phone (paying $3.16 a month) after getting rid of Verizon (for which I was paying $50.00 a month).\\n\\nPROS\\nIt works most of the time although sound quality is not as good as regular phone.\\nEasy to set up.\\n\\nCONS\\nOnce in a while the phone will keep on ringing even after you hang up and then you have to exit out of the Vosky software and start again.\\nYou need a computer.\\n\\nIn summary good value for money and the best way to use Skype as your phone until phones that can be used without computer like Skype Wi-Fi phones Netgear and Belkin come down in cost and their bugs are worked out; or a phone adapter like this product comes out that plugs directly to the router\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAlthough I could go on and on about how Skype has changed my life forever, I will try to address the issue at hand, and that is the Polycom Communicator.  Basically I love the concept of the Polycom Communicator!  When I first started using Skype I used a USB headset that works great.  The problem is that it is a serious PITA to put the thing on when someone calls because I have to either a. Try to untangle the cord before accepting the skype connection, or b. answer the skype connection then try to untangle the cord.  If I chose option a. envariably I would miss half the calls, if I chose option b. everyone would always comment that I sounded so desheveled when I tried to answer the call.  Well, now with the new Polycom communicator all I have to do is answer the call.\\n\\nAs far as the quality and performance of the Polycom communicator...that is the only reason I didn\\'t give the item 4 stars.  It seems ocasionally that when you are in large conference calls that the Polycom communicator will cause feedback to other peoples lines.  It is really sporadic though, and I can\\'t seem to reproduce it consistently.  Also, the driver for the Polycom Communicator has crashed on me a couple of times.\\n\\nSo despite the downfalls that I mentioned above, there is no way I could give up my Polycom Communicator now.  I simply love it, I just wish those other issues never happened\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWell, actually I bought this nice cable, at Amazon Marketplace great offering that it was, for an HDTV Tuner, which bombed in my neighborhood.

Great cable, @ great price, thru Amazon\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m a Creative fan so these are the first Logitech speakers I ever bought and I was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a set of speakers for my laptop but since the portable models are more expensive (and probably will not sound as good since being portable means no sub-woofer) I decided for this not-as-portable model.\\nWell, these are perfect to keep on your desktop (though the ideal placement of any sub-woofer is on the floor close to a corner), as it has a small sized sub-woofer all controls in one the speakers.\\n\\nThese speakers sound really nice, slightly superior sound to Creative\\'s corresponding model (SBS 350) but with less output power (Creative\\'s SBS 350 sub-woofer is larger and more powerful)\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n- Headphone jack and POWER button in the left speaker\\n- No \"wired remote\" (which adds more clutter to your desktop)\\n- Nice design for the price\\n- Even cheaper than Creative\\'s SBS 350\\n\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Small sub-woofer\\n- No \"wired remote\" which means you have to keep one of the speakers close.\\n- No bass control (which usually means too much bass if your audio source has no equalization control\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought one of these to replace the standard 32MB card that came with my camera. Wow, now I can store a ton of pictures. The price on the EP Memory cards are awesome too\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have the Quest 2, but I\\'ve heard that this also fits the Quest. I bought it because, while my Dell laptop backpack is well padded, I wanted to make sure that my Quest 2 GPS was protected \"just in case\". This case fits perfectly, literally like a glove. When I got it, I was sceptical; it looked to small, but I was wrong; the dimensions are perfect. And there is more than enough padding to protect the GPS from harm, yet it is small enough to stick in a jacket pocket, which I sometimes have to (late day meetings where I leave my backpack at work). All in all, it\\'s another great product from Garmin\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have been using these fans for the stalls in our horse barn for years. It keeps the flies away and cools down the whole barn. The barn is dusty and the fans collect a lot of dirt. I wash them down each year and they are like new. The fans I have now are on their third barn year. In a normal house I\\'m sure they would last forever. They are a little noisy, but the horses don\\'t care\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI purchased this dashmount so I could swap the GPS between vehicles without having to install a permanent mount.  I don\\'t know what the \"feet\" of the base is made of, but it is basically like a rubber version of a lead blanket - it is heavy yet is very pliable.  This is useful since my dash (a 2004 F-250) has an uneven surface.  I can press and mold the feet to put the base in a certain position and under most circumstances it\\'ll stay there.  Occasionally, on long or \"bouncy\" trips, it\\'ll creep out of position a couple inches and I\\'ll have to move it back.  I\\'ve seen some comments complaining of that - but I don\\'t see it as a problem since common sense says it won\\'t stay perfectly still since it isn\\'t bolted in place.  Overall this mount has worked very well.\\n\\nMy wife is going on a business trip next week and will be borrowing the GPS - I don\\'t recommend she take the mount though - since the thing must way at least a couple pounds - too bulky and heavy to put in a suit case in my opinion\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI got the dash mount because a friend recommended it.  I thought the windshield mount worked fine except it was difficult to remove from the windshield.  I felt like I should remove it each time I parked somewhere.  Also, there was a fair amount of vibration since it usually was dangling. The dash mount is very heavy and flexible enough to \"mold\" to fit the surface of the dash.  However, it kept slipping off the surface of my Toyota Avalon until I found a little sticky pad to put it on.  That solved that problem.  Anyway, it is very easy to move it to the floorboard and cover it up when I stop, thus effectively hiding it from the temtation of a robber\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is my first HOTAS, but I did a good bit of research.  It is very easy to set up, and the SST Programming is very helpful setting the shift key.  The joystick is easy to move, which is nice in a close dogfight.  I am very glad that I bought this HOTAS, because I have had NO problems with it.  I highly recommend this system to anyone\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\n...for a surge protector.  But as far as I can tell, it\\'s doing its job.  Plus it looks kind of neat\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWe bought this drum set for our 2 year old who is obsessed with the concept of drumming &amp; marching.  This is a first class set and as noted is almost too nice.  This is a huge step above the tupperware and pan lids our little guy used to use for his personal parades.  The drum is a bit heavy,large, cumbersonme for a two year old and of course is LOUD.  The cymbals are also loud but do have a professional sound quality. Do recommend this purchase. It does come a bit steep at $30 but is a very nice looking and performing set.  If you little one gets hooked on drumming via the pots and pans, spoil him/her with this first-class set that they should be able to use well into their childhood\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI found this as the perfect solution to fill in some dead airt space in my house downstairs given the internet connection is upstairs and so far, other wireless solutions have been marginal. I really wondered if the Ethernet over powerlines would really work or if the 802.11G would really work. \\n\\nSo I get my new Extender kit, unbox it and plug everything in without bothering to read the directions. Lets be real, this stuff SHOULD be plug and play and IT WAS. It came right up and worked and has worked for the past three months flawlessly. I have decent range downstairs, it works with the Macs and the PCs and doesnt seem to care a whit.

The charger charges \\'em both, or not, as you see fit.  The instructions are clear and to the point.  The installation instructions are slightly out of date - you don\\'t need a card reader to make it happen, after all - and the user experience is, in my case, outstanding.

I studied many other speaker stands and it just didn\\'t seem I would have been getting the same quality. \\n\\nI received this pair a few days ago and originally thought they may be a little complicated to put together.  They only took about twenty minutes to assemble and put my cube speakers on.  The stands look great and go well with the cube speakers.

I was really impressed by the quality of the pictures rendered on that paper by my printer.  When the paper ran out I looked for an economical replacement and found the price of most photo papers to be prohibitive - on the order of 40 cents per page.  Since you can only get 2 4x6 pics from a letter-sized sheet of paper, that comes to about 20 cents per print, not counting the cost of ink.  Finally I stumbled upon this paper - Epson S041727 - and the price per print was around 12 cents, which rivals the cheapest Internet photo printing services I\\'ve found.\\n\\nIf you print a lot of 4x6 pictures, this is a great value for a great product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nHands down Epson Paper is the best photo paper on the market.\\nAt this price its a no brainer.A++++++++++\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis adapter is functional, is easy to use, enables continued use of backlight, and saves the batteries for walking with the eMap after arriving in a strange town.

My birthday was last week and I bought myslef the pink 4GB Nano. It is easy to use, but I have to agree it takes some time on itunes to import CD\\'s, the ipod updates fast but the CD import is slow. The sound quality is good. I like that it is small and lightweight. The screen is bright and easy to read...even with not so young eyes. I looked at other brands but am glad I went with the leader. I didn\\'t need or want to watch movies on a tiny screen...just tunes. I\\'m sure 1000 songs will hold me. \\n\\nI looked all over at prices and Amazon wins! The free shipping is a great bonus also.\\n\\nThe case may look delicate but it feels very sturdy to me, I have had it in my pocket and it is just fine. Would highly recommend this MP3. It is cute to boot! This not so young person thinks it is WAY COOL\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI had been storing my music on a 2GB card in my palm pilot. I was having a lot of trouble transferring the music, with many errors, not to mention how long it took to transfer. I finally decided to get an MP3 player. A friend kept telling me about the Sandisk Sanso. There were some great features, but the bad far, far outweighed the good. Too many of the same problems over and over, and many people returning them. \\nI got my Apple iPod last night and have hardly put it down! I did a lot of research first and was hard pressesd to find negative feedback about this item. This thing is great! I was up till 3AM listening to my music. The sound quality is so much better than I had expected! \\nI really like the case I got (Tuffwrap Accent by XtremeMac- Walmart and Radio Shack) because it is really tough rubber and all of the holes are in the right place for the new nano. The only thing is that the unit does not slide up into it completely because of the square corners of the nano. The case has more rounded corners in the top, so the nano does not line up just right in the case. It is good enough and you can still use the controls. It is only about a 1/4 of an inch at most. I am just picky about it lining up correctly so this is a bit annoying. But the case is still great as far as protection. \\nI also bought the Belkin TuneBase FM transmitter for the car. It is similar to the Monster version. I did not like the Belkin version at all. I ended up going and getting the Monster FM transmitter at Radio Shack. It works great! I like the fact that my Ipod lays in the console rather than sitting in a dock (some of you may prefer the dock). I like that I can pick up the Ipod and use it sort of like a remote to the radio because I can operate it easily without looking down at the dock. I can even hold it while driving if I want to flip through the songs while driving rather than having to reach over to the dock. The sound of this transmitter is great. Some areas you might get a bit of static or station bleed through while driving, but this is minimal and is usually not a problem. I find this happened a lot less with Monster than with the Belkin. The Belkin had a nasty hiss over all of the songs. \\nPeople are talking about this unit not having a radio on it, but I find that I have so many favorite songs on it that I do not need a radio. When I do have a radio, all I do is channel surf for songs I like anyway. This way, I already have all the songs I like at my fingertips!\\nI think these headphones really make this nano great! I was so surprised when I first heard this little unit play! For something so tiny, it rocks! I am really glad I followed my gut and went with this unit instead of dealing with frustration first by getting the Sanso. This new nano is a must have!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWell the most important thing about buying ink and toner for your printer is price, and Amazon.com has beaten every on-line price I have seen. As for the toner itself, Hewlett Packard toner is top. I buy this product for two  reasons, 1. It\\'s what fits in my printer, and 2. I know when I buy the  C3906A, I am getting what I payed for, a quality cartrige that lasts. One  last note, twords the end of the cartrige life, a small line appears in the  content of my page letting me know its allmost time for a new one. simply  shake the cartrige, reorder, and by the time the new one arrives, the old  one is finished\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI\\'m not much of a techie.  But, I do have lots of documents and pictures that I can\\'t bear to lose should my computer decide to konk out one day.  \\n\\nI used to back up my most important files on CD: an overly complex and tedious process involving multiple CDs and lots of time.  But, with this 2GB flash drive backing up my important documents is just a matter of plugging the device in and selecting which files and folders to synchronize.  The files are copied over to the device quickly, and easily.\\n\\nThe 2 Gig storage capacity allows me to backup all of my most important photos and documents on one handy removeable drive.  \\n \\nScanDisk even includes a \"Synch\" software that simplifies the process of identifying and copying your important data.  (The software also helps you copy over your Outlook messages, folders, appointments, tasks, and other data that used to be difficult for me to find on my hard drive.)  \\n\\nAlso, I can imagine that the use of the Synch software with this little drive would made it very easy to keep the data on your work machine syched up with the data on your home machine.\\n\\nPhysically, the unit is small, sleek with a case that feels substantial.  The retractable connector functions smoothly and allows the case to protect the connector when not in use.  \\n\\nThis thing is great.  I only wish I\\'d started using it sooner. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI ordered the apple ipod shuffle sport case because I wanted something to protect my ipod from the elements and just general bumping and scraping.

I wasn\\'t expecting as good or better quality than I can already get, but I hoped the Samson C01B USB Studio Condenser would at least give me a decent sound.  The idea was to have freedom and portablility that my studio set up prohibits.  I was not disappointed.  Installation was no more complicated that plugging the cable into a USB port on my laptop running XP and the other end into the mic.  It is far from the best mic I have, but it is certainly not the worst.  I have read reviews that say the recording quality is too thin, but I found that not to be the case.  The noise floor when recording with the Samson is a little high, and it is lacking in headroom compared to any traditional mic through my Millenia preamp.   I have to record at slightly lower levels than I am used to, but for $79, I am not complaining.  There is no significant latency recording 16 bits at 44100hz in Fasoft N-Track Studio.  The ability to plug this thing in and record at a whim is quite liberating.

I\\'ve had cordless Panasonic phones break too often in the past so was reluctant to buy one again.  But the other choices had major drawbacks.  I really needed a two-line phone that wasn\\'t 2.4Ghz.\\n\\nThe first I tried was the Uniden TRU8866.  It had a bad echo on the extra handset and other people complained about that too.  This phone uses phone company voice mail (no built-in ans mach) - which is fine - but I had the VM system go bonkers so lost all trust in it.  For over a week messages accumulated but we got no stutter-tone so didn\\'t know there were any new messages - arrgghh.  Not the phones fault I know but it required VM for messaging so nope. \\n\\nNext I tried the new Motorola MD7081.  I really wanted to like this phone. It\\'s a 2-line 5.8Ghz ans machine like the Panasonic 6500B.  I liked it\\'s simplicity and easy switching between line 1 and 2.  Had battery backup for use during power outages and the best voice quality of the three.  But, it\\'s answering system has no message counter.  That alone is no big deal but it didn\\'t have any indicator to say whether you had any saved messages.  When a new message arrived it blinked and such - all good.  But, if I got home, say, and listened to a message for my wife, the blinking stopped and no indication of \"1 saved message\" or anything.  So, I would have to write a note to her to check the messages.  We\\'re so used to relying on seeing a message counter and just listening to them if it\\'s not zero that we thought this would become a nuisance.  I also would have liked an auto-line-selection so it would automatically answer the ringing line or select a non-busy outgoing line.  But, that would have messed up their simpler style button function - hmmm.\\n\\nThe Panasonic, I am surprised to say, ended up being my favorite.  Hopefully it will be reliable.  I was always bothered by Panasonic\\'s phones losing the date/time with any little power outage.  Happily, this phone sets its date/time from caller-id info even though the manual implies it wouldn\\'t work quite that way.  With the right settings and phone company options (busy-forward), it elegantly supports two lines as if they are one.  I really like not thinking about which line is what - just pick up and talk.\\n\\nThe 6500B has good voice quality and reasonable range.  It\\'s much lighter than earlier caller-id handsets which I like.  I also like their shape of handset the best.  My gripes are the limit of 4 handsets - I would like 6 or 7.  Also, can\\'t name the handsets so with intercom you have to remember each number\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI love my new Monster FM Transmitter!

They are super comfortable and seem to block the world out.  I\\'ve been using them for about 3 months now and couldn\\'t be happier eventhough I\\'ve got a healthy dose of ear wax building up on them\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis isn\\'t my first mp3 player. I have a couple of the years and since my last one died I was looking for a quick, cheap replacement. I also needed a flash drive for work. Don\\'t underestimate this, if you use the net at a library or cafe then you\\'ll realize that 1. not all players/drives are recognized as drives and/or 2. you\\'ve got to carry an extra cord with you to plug into the usb port, which gets annoying quickly. when you clean out your purse and discover you don\\'t have it with you. With this you get both in one. It has a built in usb port which is recognized fine in most operating systems, even win98. The sound quality is good, I can\\'t tell the difference between this and my $100.00 player. The controls do take a few seconds to get used to, but once I did I find I preferred them. They are easy to use one-handed.\\n\\nAn unexpected bonus is that its great for audiobooks! If you turn off the player, it starts back up exactly where you left it, be it in the middle of a song or in the middle of a chapter! Its small without being too tiny, its design is simple enough that there is nothing to fall off or get lost and technophobes won\\'t have a heart-attack. Its doesn\\'t hold a lot of music at only 128mb or have a shuffle feature, but if you need to carry more than an album or 2, or need extra features then you\\'ll want more than this player anyway. \\n\\nThe best feature is the price. I found this one at my local ToysRUs for $15.00. It also plays both mp3\\'s and wma. It won\\'t play AAC but if most of your music is this format you\\'ll better off with an ipod.\\n\\nThis would make a good first player for a kid or for someone who needs a usb drive and music without all the bells and whistles. \\n\\nI\\'m giving it 5 stars because it does exactly what I need it to do without any hassle\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI decided to purchase this item because I needed to get SD memory for my g/friends digital camera, so I chose this one because of the price and the brand. SanDisk is known for their memory. Well, no need to say more, this thing works great. I will buy another one but with more space anyday. Thanks alot San Disk\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\njust got this one at sears, and was only $20 so i grabbed it. the Canon A400 i have only came with 16mb so i needed more space. the 128 is much faster and easy to format than my old one. love it!!! go out and buy one today! GET SANDISK NOT LEXAR, THEY BREAK ALL THE TIME!!!!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nHow many pictures will it store?  It is the most commonly asked question from digital camera enthusiast but usually the question that is the most difficult to get a straight answer about.  Well, considering I worked in the memory industry for over 7 years I can help clarify this perplexing question and do so unbiased as I have since changed industries.  \\n\\nThe SanDisk SDSDB-128-A10 Secure Digital 128MB, like most 128MB cards, will store on average 142 pictures when used with a 2 megapixel camera, 106 images when used with a 3 megapixel camera,  64 pictures when used with a 4 megapixel camera, 51 images when used with a 5 megapixel camera, and 40 pictures when used with a 6 megapixel camera.  These numbers are based off the assumption that you are going to shoot your images at the highest quality JPEG setting available for the camera and understand that they are estimates and may be off by as much as 10 percent due to numerous factors including the complexity of the scene being shot and the compression algorithm used by your specific camera.\\n\\nI truly hope this review was helpful to you in determining whether this card is the right capacity for your specific needs\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIf you buy this service plan, print out the contract (found at the top of this page) and keep your receipt. I did not purchase the plan, but looked over the contract intensely since I nearly got it.\\n\\nSome notes on the contract:\\n1. It is only good in the United States (including Washington, DC, but MINUS MAINE), but it does not include Guam, Virgin Islands, etc. So if you are in another country or outside the 50 states + D.C., this contract will be nothing but a waste of money.\\n2. This contract is transferable and the directions to do so are simple.\\n3. They will only fix/replace/etc IF the manufacturing warranty no longer covers the item. That is, if the manu. warranty is still good, you have to use it.\\n4. If the item needs to be shipped, shipping/handling will only be covered if the manufacturer would cover those costs in their warranty period. If the item is being replaced, \"You will be responsible for the delivery or cost of delivery of the covered Product to Our authorized service center. Reimbursement will be issued in the form of a check payable to You.\" I\\'m uncertain if that means you cover those costs or they reimburse you.\\n5. No lemon policy of 3 service repairs for the SAME defect, and a upon the time of a 4th repair, as determined by them, they will \"replace it with a product of comparable performance. Repairs performed while the Product is under manufacturer\\'s warranty DO NOT APPLY.\" (Doesn\\'t sound like a great no lemon policy... your product would have to breakdown in the same way 4 times in the number of years they cover you -- many electronics are typically already covered by the manufacturer for 1 year.)\\n6. There are numerous conditions that they will not repair for, but they all sound typical of such plans (such as, they don\\'t cover accidents and they don\\'t cover \"the elements or acts of God\" ... sorry, I had to note that second one since it stuck out to me from the other things). But, in all seriousness, read the list before you purchase.\\n\\nSo, now that I have summarized much of the contract, if you want to get the service warranty, PLEASE READ THE CONTRACT SINCE I DIDN\\'T COVER EVERYTHING!!! (Don\\'t hold me liable since I don\\'t have much money anyways.) Also, I think this is typical in warranty contracts, but you will occassionally see the phrase \"at our discretion\" in the contract.\\n\\nAssuming they aren\\'t jerks with their discretion and aren\\'t too tough to deal with, I would give the warranty 4 stars (minus 1 star for the crappy lemon policy). I didn\\'t get the coverage because the product I was going to get it for had just made into the next price category (so it was pricy for my product, being at the lower price end of the scale)\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThere is absolutely nothing that we don\\'t like about these Panasonic phones.  The sound quality is excellent as is the range.  Very happy customers\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have had mine for a week. I had a non mapping garmin gps 12 for years, which was misplaced. I bought the navigation kit at the same time I ordered a 60 CS. It makes what I bought for backpacking usable as a car navigation tool both in the city and out in the boonies. I had no problems loading software and maps, upload or download from/to my gps.\\n\\nI am impressed by the softwares ability to \"recalculate\" in navigation mode. If I ignore the suggested route, it continually adapts to suggest a new route based on where I am.\\n\\nI am sure that some portions of the database is not current as far as new roads etc. are concerned but I am impressed with the degree of information that is currently contained. I have gotten messages regarding keeping right for example (to avoid being caught in what becomes a left turn only lane), and knowledge of one-way streets etc.\\n\\nThe real test is yet to come to negotiate San Francisco\\'s endless no left turns, one way streets, construction and limited freeway on ramps!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThree months later, I\\'m still amazed at how cheap this amazing piece of hardware was. Granted, it doesn\\'t vibrate, nor have a zillion buttons, but it definitely performs admirably. It is comfortable and the buttons respond well. The unit feels well-built, and connects to the computer easily via USB. And as a bonus, it looks pretty too. :\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this based on the overall positive reviews.  Good sound quality, and a comfortable fit.  I didn\\'t find them to be too tight at all.  For a low-end pair of headphones, I think they\\'re pretty impressive\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe cups of these heaphone are a little small and they do fit snuggly on my head but after stretching them out a bit I must say they are very comfortable. If you dont like them at first wear them for a while, they will grow on you.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIf you went to circuit city, you would see this is $30 there. Here its only 8.99!

Works right away with Windows XP, no driver install or software needed for two-button and normal scroll capabilities.  Software allows for extra button assignment, but could use some work.  I have had some trouble finding the menus I want when I want to find them.  For example, I have an issue where I cannot find the extra button assignment menu after plugging in the USB receiver after a system start-up, however I am able to find those menus in the software if I remove and reinsert the receiver.\\nBut as I said before, superb mouse function and tracking...this thing works on upholstery, leather, my jeans, and thick carpet!!\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe V200 is another great Logitech product. It is far from the king of the mouse, but when it comes to the notebook it doesn\\'t get much better than this. It takes two AA batteries (so get some rechargeable batteries to save on costs) which slide into the top of the mouse by pulling back on the palm rest to reveal two slots. The mouse doesn\\'t weigh too much heavier than the two mouse batteries themselves. This is a two button mouse with a tilt wheel. With the setpoint software you can alter what the buttons do. Overall the design is good. There could be a problem installing setpoint. It may hang on install. If so you need to use the task manager to quit the install and then try it again. It should work. The USB receiver is 2.4 GHz and has a 10 Meter range. Wow. However there is one major problem with a wireless mouse for a notebook. USB dongles and receivers that are plugged into the side of the laptop are just begging to be snapped off. For this reason you should have the USB receiver on the side opposite the mouse hand, if you can, to avoid accidental contact. It should also not be hanging over the edge of the table. If you press it down lightly, then that is it, game over for the receiver and you will have to get a new 2.4 GHz receiver. So okay you will have to spend on a new receiver, if you break the old one. The receiver plugs into a small slot under the mouse using a magnet. When it is in the holder the mouse turns off. It doesn\\'t fit in smoothly. It creates a block shape in the bottom of the mouse. Anyway you are not going to be using it when it is clipped in. The other thing is that it can pop out sometimes. Just happens if the mouse just gets knocked a certain way. I am sure most notebook users are cautious with their notebooks and devices. If you are then a mouse like this and USB should last for a very long time. There is really nothing wrong with it. Wireless mini mouse. FAB! However there is one last thing to say. If you don\\'t like the idea of a USB receiver then GET A BLUETOOTH VERSION OF THIS MOUSE INSTEAD. It is called the V270. That is if your notebook has internal Bluetooth or else you will need to get a Bluetooth USB receiver and be in the same boat when it comes to watching your USB receivers. But if you have a Bluetooth internal receiver with your notebook then by all means head over to the V270 and forget about this USB option. The USB design isn\\'t a fault with the mouse; it is just a fault with all notebooks that is not really a fault. You just got to switch to internal Bluetooth or learn to take care of your receivers.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nWhen I purchased this product I was a little sceptical, however, once I unpacked it and started using it, it was so absolutely easy to use, and the pictures have such a fine quality, and you can insert 4 different sizes of memory cards in addition to computer connection.  So, I see it as a win/win product.  The only draw back is the weight and size. I just do not regret this purchase with the price an added bonus as wel\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nFirst and foremost--I am not an audiophile, so I can\\'t comment with any authority on the quality of the headphones themselves.  They are fine for me and my listening habits--I find myself increasingly listening to podcasts when commuting via bus for which these headphones are perfectly fine, although when I do listen to my music the bass and treble response seems fine to me.\\n\\nThat being said, what I wanted was a convenient way to carry my 2G Nano so I could listen and manipulate the controls with the iPod handy yet out of the way.  This lanyard does an excellent job of providing that and I would recommend it to anyone.\\n\\nSo why four stars?  Well, for a few reasons:\\n\\n--Only available in white.  I have a black 2G 8GB Nano.  I\\'d have liked to match it.\\n\\n--No lock or release on the base that connects to the Nano.  While the connector does fit snug with the Nano and doesn\\'t disconnect so easily from the Nano that I\\'d fear it might fall off while walking about, I would have felt more secure with some sort of lock or release mechanism holding it in place.\\n\\nFor this reason I would not recommend the lanyard to anyone doing any sort of strenuous activity or exercise--but hanging loose around the neck really isn\\'t the best place for the Nano then anyway.  The armband would be more appropriate.\\n\\n--NOWHERE on the packaging did it say this was for the 2G Nano!  I had bought a 1G Nano lanyard at a local store and had to return it when I discovered it was incompatible (the dock connector and headphone jack on the 1G and 2G Nanos are NOT the same distance apart).  When this 2G lanyard arrived, I could find nothing on the package that said \"for 2G Nano\", so I opened it very gingerly thinking I had received the wrong lanyard and would need to repackage it and send it back.  I was very relieved when it did fit!  Regardless, there should be a very clear \"For 2G Nanos only!\" label on the box to alleviate 2G Nano owners\\' fears and to warn 1G Nano owners.\\n\\nAll in all, I am very happy with the lanyard.  It keeps the Nano handy while leaving my hands free, and that was what I was looking for\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nIt\\'s been through the wringer, and has had no problems after about a year. I came here looking for a replacement cap, but can\\'t find one on Amazon\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI downloaded the driver from Trendnet\\'s website before installing the adapter. I did not encounter any problems at all, including the issue that some users had with it disconnecting when they plugged in another USB device\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe Sennheiser HD600s have only one thing wrong with them: they\\'ll change you from someone who enjoys good audio... into an audiophile! I\\'ve been known as a videophile for many years over on one of the top AV forums, but I\\'ve always been satisfied with merely \"decent\" audio.  Until now.\\n\\nI\\'d previously ripped all my CDs into the (previously quite impressive) Windows Media format at 192K bps, but that\\'s now useless.  With the phenomenal ability of the Sennheiser HD600s to reveal all the subtle nuances of your music, listening to compressed discs is like listening to your music through a thick layer of vaseline.  Here we go again... it\\'s time to rip everything into lossless format.\\n\\nI cannot recommend these headphones more highly - they are simply extraordinary.  When your tastes become accustomed to this level of quality, though, life\\'s going to get a lot more expensive, as you try to update everything to match your new level of sonic differentiation.\\n\\nStill, this is a bloody miracle.  My ears have finally been opened.  Wow\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nHaving been a buyer of Sennheiser products for over 10 years, I feel it is time I endorse a product I truly believe in, and have never been let down by. Including service and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nEach time buying a Sennheiser product, I found myself stepping up to the next level of their headphones, because they simply keep improving their technology to the point that what you used to own by them gets overwhelmed by the latest headphone they offer. When I bought the HD-600\\'s, I had just come away from years owning the HD-25. When these encountered a technical problem, I replaced them with a backup choice, the HD-25SP\\'s. The difference in sound going \\'lower\\' down their scale of products was just too much to bear. So I bit the bullet and went higher. \\n\\nWhether you use Sennheiser\\'s merely for pleasure, or for studio work, the accuracy of their sound, and what you get for your money cannot be beat. My HD-600\\'s ran into a small technical glitch (and Sennheiser were extremely helpful in getting this fixed and replaced within 2 days of receipt), and I swear I nearly cried in their absence. HD-600\\'s give you a clear idea of how things were recorded, how good your system is, and what truly sounds inferior. You never listen to things quite the same way again.\\n\\nThe reason my reviews of Paul McCartney and John Lennon albums from the 70\\'s all comment on how inferior the recording quality is (especially compared to the so called \\'\\'Economy Class Beatles\\'\\' George Harrison\\'s and Ringo Starr\\'s albums from the same decade), is down to what HD-600\\'s reveal. My main source of media tends to be Vinyl, because Compact Discs and DVD\\'s still cannot capture what analogue/turntable equipment captures. Vinyl is simply warmer and more \\'round\\' in comparison to its digital counterparts. And when listening to badly recorded albums, HD-600\\'s make you wonder if you spent more on your headphones than the artist did using a studio. HD-600\\'s are the reason I mention time and time again you are not getting value for money when buying Lennon and McCartney solo albums. Listening to \\'\\'Take IT Away\\'\\' from 1982\\'s Tug Of War reveals an annoying tape hiss coming from the left side of the stereofield. Which sounds much like someone forgot to \\'silence\\' a track that had a recording on it, before the instrument actually showed up in the song. It sounds totally like electrical / amp noise coming from equipment, and Geoff Emerick or George Martin just simply forgot to keep this track silent until the instrument that occupied that track appeared in the song. \\n\\nIt gets much worse than \\'Take It Away\\' on Paul McCartney albums, and even more painfully so on John Lennon albums. But listening pleasure can be found recording wise on their solo albums BACK TO THE EGG, RAM, DOUBLE FANTASY, MILK AND HONEY, and some portions of BAND ON THE RUN, and WALLS AND BRIDGES. #9 Dream is simply a gorgeous recording, it\\'s just too bad the rest of the album doesn\\'t sound as good as that one song.\\n\\nWhen you listen to your CD\\'s, vinyl, DVD\\'s in whatever room of your house your speakers are, the room dictates what you hear, no matter what you\\'ve spent on speakers, power amps, woofers, sub-dividers, etc. Whether you have wall to wall carpeting, high ceilings, low ceilings, plaster or cement, wood floors, a more long than wide room, it all affects how sound reaches your ear. Which is why on a great set of headphones, you are more likely to hear HOW those sounds were meant to be heard, how they were recorded, and how much time was spent doing it. On speakers, McCartney\\'s JET sounds quite full, though the snare is a little thin. But when hearing the album with HD-600\\'s, the drums nearly become non-existent, and all the inconsistencies of the recording become so apparent, you wonder if the mix was sabotaged by someone. McCartney on drums is not a miracle, especially when you hear many of the mistakes being made by someone not as confident on that instrument as they are on Bass. \\n\\nCan I review anything without bringing up Lennon and McCartney? Quite possibly Dog Food. But so far, they come up pretty regularly. Makes you wonder if I\\'m trying to prove a point doesn\\'t it.\\n\\nAlbums that are phenomenally recorded get due justice with Sennhesier HD-600\\'s. They truly do. Some noteworthy recordings from the 70\\'s and 80\\'s when recording technology (for popular music) was just beginning to reach new highs, that are all HD-600 friendly:\\n\\nIsao Tomita\\'s The Firebird (1976)\\nGeorge Harrison\\'s eponymous album (1979)\\nSteely Dan\\'s Gaucho (1980)\\nJoe Walsh\\'s The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get (1973)\\n10CC\\'s The Original Soundtrack (1975)\\nGodley &amp; Creme\\'s Consequences (1977)\\nSupertramp\\'s Crime of the Century (1974)\\nXTC\\'s Black Sea (1980)\\nPeter Gabriel\\'s 3rd album (1980)\\nKate Bush\\'s The Dreaming (1982)\\nEarth Wind and Fire\\'s All \\'n\\' All (1977)\\nLevel 42\\'s The Pursuit of Accidents (1982)\\nBilly Cobham\\'s Spectrum (1972)\\nFrank Zappa\\'s One Size Fits All (1975)\\nRingo Starr\\'s Goodnight Vienna (1974)\\n\\nand a truly incredible sounding album from the 90\\'s, Prince and The New Power Generation\\'s \\'\\'Symbol\\'\\' album from 1992.\\n\\nAlbums NOT HD-600 friendly:\\nTodd Rundgren\\'s Hermit of Mink Hollow (1978)\\nBlue Oyster Cult\\'s Agents of Fortune (1976)\\nPaul McCartney\\'s Venus and Mars (1975 - and quite a few others)\\nJohn Lennon\\'s Imagine (1971 - and avoid 1970\\'s Instant Karma like the plague, the piano track will hurt you . .  )\\nYes\\'s Fragile (often the guitars and keyboards hit frequencies that cause a lot of crackling and clipping)\\n\\nand surprisingly enough, many remasters of albums once on vinyl or antiquated CD reveal the errors of fixing something that ain\\'t broken.  \\n\\n\\nIf you have to save up for a pair, or do some heavy searching for HD-600\\'s that are affordable, do so. In over 10 years I have never been disappointed by anything Sennheiser distributed, especially when I kept up with their pace.\\n\\n\\n\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI just purchased one of these and was a little sceptical after reading some of the reviews that stated how difficult it was to load the information into the unit. I had no problem at all. In fact it was quite simple. I am truly amazed at how acurate and easy to use this unit is. For the price, you can\\'t beat it\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought the Transcend 1 GByte card for my PDA. My Axim x51v immediately recognized it and is working flawless for the past few weeks. I am planning to get the 4GB model too which is currently retailing for $90 to $110 elsewhere.\\n\\nHar\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI was mislead with Amazon review which said it supports conversion to MP3 format with the software supplied, it does not. The help quite clearly states \"You cannot convert a file into an MP3 file\". It will convert to .wav then you can use a 3rd party program to go to MP3.\\n\\nIf it had MP3 support (at least conversion on the PC from the Sony proprietary format which is .msv) I would have given it 5 stars due to the good software supplied and the amazing sound quality possible. It you record in full quality mode (1.25 hours with built in 32meg memory) and listen to it again with good headphones it does sound amazing. The Voice Up (so you hear each person in a conversation) works very well as do other nice features.\\n\\nBut it is let down with the software supplied not performing MP3 conversion. Going to .wav then .mp3 with another program is a pain and simply converting to .wav to get away from proprietary .msv takes up too much space.\\n\\nBut I would buy one again, as it is very easy to use, small, and very high quality. I just hope Sony would listen to consumers and support MP3\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is the same cartridge I can purchase elsewhere, but cheaper.  It works well in our printer with no issues whatsoever and my HP printer prints fantastic photos when I use HP ink and HP premium photo paper\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNo complaints - I\\'m pleased with the quality and price\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nBefore I bought this device, I was trying to enjoy the \"Hearts of Space\" website, \"This American Life\" and other NPR shows available for online streaming.  Only problem was, I didn\\'t like being shackled to my computer in order to hear them.   I did some research on the internet, read a lot of reviews and ultimately decided on the Logitech Wireless Music System.  I would like to echo all the positive comments recorded here.\\n\\nIt was indeed quite fast and easy to set up.  No lengthy manuals to read (thank goodness.)  I did not find it necessary to load the CD software that came with the device.  If I want to listen through the stereo, I plug in the USB.  If I want to listen through the computer, I simply unplug the USB.  It\\'s very simple.\\n\\nI am 100% satisfied with the sound quality.  I would not be able to tell the difference between FM radio and the online streaming.  However, I do have to turn up my stereo about twice as loud when I am sending internet audio streams to it using this device, than when I am listening to a CD or the radio.  On my stereo (which isn\\'t fancy), this does not cause diminished sound quality, so I\\'m perfectly OK with it.  I just have to remember to turn down the volume before switching back to CD or radio listening.\\n\\nIf you are wondering whether the device will be compatible with your stereo, check for two things.  First, your stereo has to have a set of two holes side-by-side that are for the twin plugs generally colored white and red.  I\\'m sorry I do not know the technical names for these things, but there\\'s a picture of the red-and-white plugs on this Amazon page in the Manufacturer\\'s \"Product Description\" section (just scroll up until you see it.)  Second, your stereo has to have a button that will let you switch to \"Auxiliary\" input.  My stereo has this, but my portable CD player/cassette player/radio (AKA boom box) does not.   If it is important to you to be able to use this on a portable player you can carry around the house and/or outside, be sure to check your player for these two things.\\n\\nOverall I am very satisfied and quite happy with the product\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe HP12C has been an essential in my personal productivity tool kit for over 20 years. I bought my first one when I was a consultant and it lasted until August 2006. It withstood all the travel and constant use well. I use it for simple and complex math; statistical analysis and financial analysis. It is much faster and simpler to operate than a PC. My new one has all the same great features. I highly recommend this for someone who is frequently required to perform mathematical and financial analysis.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn\\'t work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse. \\nAnother nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThis is a great printer.  I have used it several times and it makes great pictures.  I had some pictures taken at a low resolution and the print still turned out looking great.  Tried this on a regular printer and the print didn\\'t look near as great.  A great feature is proof sheet print of the pictures you have.  You can also add a border to your pictures which makes things nice for postcards.\\n\\nColors are great and vivid.  Also the prints look like that purchased from a photo shop.  I have not tried printing to non Epson paper so I can\\'t say how prints would look.  I know that Epson printers look the best printed on Epson paper. \\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nThe camers is good in picture quality and easy to install and use. It\\'s multi utility for desktop and notepad is a very good feature which I personally expected. I have a complete satisfaction\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nAlthough the rear speakers need a power plug, this system solved my problem of being unable to run a signal wire to the back speakers from the front. The sound is OK, not awesome, but not bad. Better than the TV speakers by a long shot. They can also be nicely controlled with my Harmony remote\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nvery good, worth the money. If you want a louder one, go for Z 535\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nNever been game player much since pong-Purhcased BF2 last December for the PC and loved it. Flying was limited though-util I purchased my G7 from NE and have been enjoying MUCHO fast speeds, easily adjusted, and for internet parusing it has a built in back button. Have to change out battery every two days but gives plenty of warning and is always charged when I need to replace. Absolutely the best mouse I have ever owned.\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI love this keyboard. \\nAfter searching through just about every keyboard available, I was torn between this and a gaming keyboard that was triple the price. I\\'m so glad that I chose this one.\\nIt is excellent! The quick access buttons are great and you can set them up almost any way you want. It\\'s a great keyboard for gaming, office use, media or just ordinary, everyday use.\\nThey keystrokes are effortless and near silent. The slide zoom feature is cool, but I don\\'t use it much. It\\'s better to have something and not need it than to need it and not have it though.\\nI really love the quick access buttons which allow me to pull up my files, e-mail or web pages with immediate ease. The only thing I don\\'t like about this keyboard is the sleep button. I NEVER use this and I can\\'t see any way to reasign it. However, it is out of the way and not a big enough deal to lower my rating of this sweet keyboard.\\nAside from all of that, how can anyone complain about a keyboard of this quality for such a great price. And it was delivered the day after I ordered it.\\nTo top it off, it feels sturdy and well made. I would reccomend this keyboard to anyone. It is a great all around keyboard with either USB or PS2 connectability\\n</review_text>, <review_text>\\nI have been into MP3s since 1996 - I used winplay, and l3enc, and thought it was the most amazing thing ever.  I bought one of the first CD based MP3 players, and then a Nomad Jukebox with a whopping 6 gig hard disk... next was the 10 gig model, and then I upgraded to the Nomad Zen 20gig with USB 2.0.  The Zen went with me everywhere - Africa, Europe, My living room.  \\n\\nAfter about 70,000 hours of use and abuse, it finally died.  \\n\\nI needed a replacement, so I looked at iPod, and Zune, but why would I stray from Creative Labs?  Besides, it\\'s better in every way - better screen than the ipod, better interface than the Zune, and a better battery than either one.\\n\\nWhen I plugged it into my computer, I was blown away.  XP found the player, and without any drivers or proprietary (think iTunes) software, I was able to drop my non-DRM ;) mp3 files right onto the generous space available.  I was listening to my music in mere minutes without installing anything, or ever being forced to reboot my PC.  I transferred a couple of movies and I\\'m looking forward to my next flight\\n</review_text>]'"

      "2682:My points of reference for that statement are my other three LCD monitors: three Samsung models, two of which are 913Ns and the other is a 712N.  These two Samsung models are advertised to have the same contrast ratio rating as this ViewSonic, and their advertised brightness ratings are 20 points higher than this ViewSonic.  \n",
      "2683:Surprisingly, I actually can see the brightness difference between the Samsungs and this ViewSonic, but, for my taste and needs, the Samsungs are simply too bright, and I end up turning down their brightnesses anyway.  \n",
      "2684:For high light, daytime use, I have found that I do like to have the brightness all the way up on the ViewSonic, but I truly do not see any need for it to be any brighter than it is capable of being.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2685:Installation was simple: in fact, something that might be helpful to those of you who are buying this would be that, interestingly again, the drivers that are on the ViewSonic website are actually older than the ones that came with my installation CD, even though the driver package that is posted on the ViewSonic website claims to have been posted only a few weeks ago.  \n",
      "2686:When I first installed this monitor and turned it on, I truly do not think the picture was as clear, or the graphics as rich, as any of the Samsung monitors that I own.  \n",
      "2687:But, and this is another tip for new users of this product, the default setting for the ViewSonic screen contrast was set MUCH lower than the maximum setting.  \n",
      "2688:When I increased the contrast up to its maximum setting, I believe the clarity and quality of the picture to be nearly equal, if not fully equal, to those on the other LCDs that I own.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2689:One big plus about this monitor is that it comes with a DVI cable included, so you save that added expense (this isn't true with all ViewSonics).  \n",
      "2690:And, especially with the digital connection, I have no doubts about ViewSonic's claim that this monitor has nearly twice (5ms versus 8ms) the refresh rate as the Samsungs.  \n",
      "2691:I have to admit that I wasn't sure I needed a widescreen display, but I believe it's going to be a challenge going back to the standard ones!  \n",

      "2693:Now for a few small negatives.  \n",

      "2696:so I really have no use for monitor speakers.  \n",

      "2698:Strains my neck.  \n",
      "2699:The reason I really didn't worry about it on this monitor was because, while there are speakers, they appear to be nearly half the height of the normal ones on other ViewSonic monitors.  \n",
      "2700:With that said, I have to admit that even this speaker accommodation bar added a bit more to the screen height than I had expected.  \n",
      "2701:For example, on the 17 inch Samsung monitor, the bottom of the screen is 3 3/4\" from the desktop.  \n",
      "2702:On the 19 inch Samsungs, it is 4 inches.  \n",
